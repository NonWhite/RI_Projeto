failed to conclude an agreement on Canadian wheat exports to
Egypt during talks last week, but the Canadian team will return
to Cairo for further negotiations, Canadian embassy officials
said.
    An embassy official declined to identify which issues
remained to be resolved and when the talks would resume.
