	<field name = "TITLE">CANADIAN SEAFARERS THREATEN STRIKE</field>
	<field name = "DATELINE">MONTREAL, March 2 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">Canadian seafarers are almost certain
to go on strike this spring in a refusal to meet rollbacks in
wages and benefits asked for by their employers, Seafarers'
International Union official Roman Gralewicz said.
    "It's 99.9 percent--I guarantee you a strike," Gralewicz
said in an interview.
    The union represents about 2,300 workers on the Great Lakes
and Canada's East and West coasts. Contract talks broke off in
January and a conciliator has been appointed to try to help
settle the dispute. The current contract expires at the end of
March.
    The seafarers' employers are also asking for a reduction in
crew levels, a move which the union said would cost about 400
jobs.
