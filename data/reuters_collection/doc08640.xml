	<field name = "content">Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told
Parliament's Lower House Finance Committee that the U.S. Is
expected to intervene in the foreign exchange market to
stabilise exchange rates, political sources said.
    Asked if the U.S. Federal Reserve Board agreed in Paris
last month to intervene to stabilise exchange rates, Miyazawa
said yes, the sources said.
    Miyazawa was also quoted as saying that he is sceptical
about the effectiveness of currency reference ranges even if
major nations agree on such an idea as it is extremely
difficult to set such ranges.
