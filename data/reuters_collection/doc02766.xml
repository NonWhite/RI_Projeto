	<field name = "DATELINE">BOGOTA, March 6 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">Colombian oil installations were not
damaged by an earthquake which shook Ecuador and southern
Colombia last night and there are no plans to suspend exports,
a spokesman for the state-run oil company Ecopetrol said.
    He said no damage was reported, unlike in Ecuador where
indefinite force majeure was declared on crude exports.
    Colombia currently produces about 360,000 barrels per day
(bpd) of crude. Exports in january totalled 123,000 bpd.
    The quake, which in Colombia measured between 6.5 and seven
on the 12-point international Mercalli scale, caused panic
among residents but no injuries were reported.
