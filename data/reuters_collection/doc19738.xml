	<field name = "BODY">Intel Corp said it has signed a
letter of intent with privately-held Silicon Compiler Systems
Corp under which Intel will become a value-added silicon vendor
for integrated circuits designed with Silicon Compiler's
GENESIL silicon compilation system.
    Under the proposed pact, Intel would provide initial
silicon foundry services for GENESIL-based designs.
    GENESIL users would be able to compile their
application-specific designs using Intel's 1.5-micron
complementary metal-oxide semiconductor process.
