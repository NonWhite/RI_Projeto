	<field name = "content">Indian and Australian businessmen
signed a memorandum of understanding to boost two-way trade and
joint industrial ventures in both countries, spokesmen of the
Indo-Australia Business Council told reporters.
    The Indian Council said it hoped India's exports to
Australia would improve in the next few months and reduce the
trade balance which is heavily in Australia's favour.
    In 1986 Australia sold 428 mln Australian dlrs' worth of
goods, including steel and coking coal, to India and bought
170.5 mln worth of items, including cotton textiles, from India.
