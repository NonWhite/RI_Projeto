	<field name = "BODY">The African Development Bank (ADB) is
seeking a broad-based cooperation agreement with the 25-member
Inter African Coffee Organisation (IACO), based in Abidjan.
    ADB secretary general Koffi Dei-Anang told a news
conference he hoped the bank's governors would approve such an
agreement at the ADB annual general meeting next week in Cairo.
The bank is seeking cooperative agreements with various
international organisations including IACO, he said.
    Dei-Anang said the ADB and IACO could cooperate on all
fronts and an exchange of information would enable them to
identify areas where the bank might help the coffee industry.
