	<field name = "BODY">Earthquakes and aftershocks are still
shaking areas of northern New Zealand following yesterday's
strong tremor which left 3,000 people homeless.
    Four earthquakes measuring up to 4.5 on the Richter scale
have hit the Bay of Plenty and Waikato region in the north-east
since midnight yesterday (1200 GMT).
    No casualties have been reported and no further major
damage, civil defence sources said.
    A government seismologist said from Rotorua in the North
Island some five tremors were being recorded every 10 minutes.
    The seismologist said if the pattern of other large
earthquakes was followed the shocks would continue for one to
several weeks, declining in frequency and magnitude. But the
chance of a further large shock could not be ruled out.
