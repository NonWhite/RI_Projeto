	<field name = "BODY">The eight major New York City banks had
64 mln dlrs in average borrowings from the Federal Reserve in
the week to Wednesday February 25, a Fed spokesman said.
    The week marked the second half of the two-week bank
statement period that ended on Wednesday. The banks had no
borrowings in the prior week.
    Commenting on the latest week, a Fed spokesman said that
all of the borrowing occurred yesterday and was done by fewer
than half of the banks.
