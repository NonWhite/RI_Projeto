	<field name = "content">Ninety-six pct of Alberta and
northeastern British Columbia crops have been seeded, about a
week ahead of the 10 year average, according to the Alberta
wheat pool report.
    Hard red spring wheat accounts for most acreage with 6.0
mln estimated for this year, little changed from last year.
Oats acreage of 1.95 mln is unchanged on last year and barley
area of 5.9 mln is also similar to last year. Rapeseed planting
of an estimated 3.24 mln is expected five pct up on 1986. The
south and south central areas of Alberta lacked moisture with
germination patchy at best. Growth prospects in northern areas
are generally in the good to very good range.
   Soil moisture is better in the north central and Peace
areas, the wheat pool said.
