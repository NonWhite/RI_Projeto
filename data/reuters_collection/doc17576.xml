	<field name = "BODY">The Federal Reserve is expected to add
reserves to the U.S. banking system by arranging a round of
customer repurchase agreements during this morning's
intervention period, several economists said.
    Some others, however, judged that the Fed has almost
completed its reserve-adding requirement for the statement
period ending on Wednesday and will not need to operate today.
    Fed funds were trading at 6-11/16 pct, compared with
Friday's average of 6.63 pct.
