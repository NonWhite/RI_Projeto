Miller told the House Appropriations Committee the Reagan
administration has "serious objections" to a supplemental
spending bill for the current fiscal year that is about to come
to a House vote.
    Miller said the bill, which as written by the
Appropriations Committee, would approve 2.7 billion dlrs in
additional 1987 spending, cut defense too harshly and gave too
much to domestic programs.
    The administration had only asked for an additional 1.1
billion dlrs in 1987 spending.
