it expects its second quarter earnings to be lower than last
year's income of seven cts per share, but its revenue for the
period should increase by 20 pct over the 2.7 mln dlrs reported

    The decline in second quarter earnings is attributable to
higher operating costs resulting from increased sales,
development and expansion, Gateway said.
