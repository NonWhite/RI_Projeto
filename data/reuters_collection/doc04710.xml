	<field name = "DATELINE">SAO PAULO, March 12 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">Two small shipping companies have
reached a pay deal with striking seamen, but union leaders said
most of Brazil's 40,000 seamen were still on strike.
    A union spokesman in Rio de Janeiro said the seamen had
accepted a 120 pct pay offer from the companies, Globo and
Flumar, which have less than 200 employees each.
    The two-week strike comes as Brazil faces a debt crisis and
is delaying exports badly needed to earn foreign exchange.
    Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto said the government will
not force a settlement of the strike, which was ruled illegal
last Friday.
