	<field name = "content">Coffee producers belonging to the "Other
Milds" group will meet May 4 in Guatemala to discuss the
possibility of restoring export quotas, producer delegates told
reporters after the closing session of the International Coffee
Organization, ICO, executive board meeting.
    The "Other Milds" group, comprising Costa Rica, Dominican
Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, India,
Mexico, Nicaragua, Papua New Guinea and Peru, might consult
with Brazil and Colombia on this meeting, but it was not
certain whether these two countries would attend, they said.
    The ICO board meeting ended without moves to restart
negotiations on quotas, which broke down last month, producer
delegates said.
    Producers are expected to hold other consultations in the
coming months on how to proceed with quota negotiations, but no
date for a full producer meeting has been mentioned, they said.
    The board completed reports on stock verification and the
next regular board session will be in Indonesia June 1-5,
delegates said.
