	<field name = "content">Indonesia, the world's second largest
producer of palm oil, has not issued licences to import the
commodity, a spokesman for the Ministry of Trade said.
    Traders in London said Indonesia has issued licences to
local operators to import around 135,000 tonnes of palm oil
starting in April, but the spokesman said this was incorrect.
    A spokesman for the Indonesian Importers Association also
denied knowledge of the import plan. He said importers would
quickly know if licences were issued. The Trade Ministry
official said there was no sign of a palm oil shortage in
Indonesia.
