	<field name = "BODY">Sci-Med Life Systems Inc said
its directors approved a previously proposed agreement of
merger with Bristol-Myers Co.
    The proposed transaction is subject to completion of a due
diligence investigation, including a review by Bristol-Myers of
a patent infringement suit served on Sci-Med by Advanced
Cardiovascular Systems Inc on March 31, 1987.
    Bristol-Myers has the right to call off the agreement under
certain circumstances, it said.
    Sci-Med said it continues to believe the patent suit is
without merit.
