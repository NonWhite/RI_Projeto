	<field name = "DATELINE">TOKYO, March 24 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">The Bank of Japan stepped up its dollar
buying as it re-entered the market after the midday Tokyo lunch
break, dealers said.
    They said the bank seemed more determined to support the
dollar than it did this morning.
    Several dealers said the central bank intervened this
afternoon when the dollar stood around 149 yen.
    One said it purchased 150 to 200 mln dlrs in the half-hour
since the market re-opened after its lunchtime closure. Another
said the bank still has buying orders in the market.
