	<field name = "BODY">The director of the Treasury
Department's office of international banking and portfolio
investment said Japan should open its bond and stock markets to
more U.S. firms.
    "The Treasury would like to see greater openness of
Jaspanese markets, including more U.S. firms admitted to the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, and an increased role for U.S. financial
firms in the Japanese Government bond market," Ammerman said in
a prepared speech for a conference on financial services
sponsored by Georgetown University.
    Ammerman also said the Reagan administration hopes "any
discrimination against U.S. banks wishing to set up in the
securities business in Japan in their own name will be
eliminated promptly."
    He said the United States also was pressing Canada to stop
giving favored treatment to domestic banks over U.S.
competitors and was talking with Canadian representatives.
    He said the United States will "press vigorously for
liberalization" of financial services in all foreign markets. If
negotiations fail, "We will not hesitate to take vigorous
actions to promote or protect our interests," he added.
