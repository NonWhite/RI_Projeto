reaffirmed his commitment to the Louvre accord struck in Paris
where leading industrialised countries agreed to stabilise the

    He told a congress of West German tax advisers in Hamburg
the policy agreed in Paris has so far been successful in the
mark/dollar relationship.
    "We want to continue it (the policy)," Stoltenberg said.
According to a text of his remarks released in Bonn, he also
