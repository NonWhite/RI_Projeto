	<field name = "BODY">Chadian troops killed 384 Libyans and
captured 48 in fighting near the key Libyan air base of Ouadi
Doum in northern Chad, a Chadian government statement said.
    The statement issued by Chad's Paris embassy said
government troops had "completely annihilated" a Libyan column
yesterday some 45 km (28 miles) from the Libyan base.
    It was the highest number of Libyan casualties reported
since January 2, when Chadian troops overran an important
garrison at the oasis of Fada with the loss of more than 700
Libyan troops.
    Ouadi Doumi, central northern Chad, is the site of Libya's
main airfield in the country and several clashes have been
reported over the past week in the surrounding desert between
troops loyal to President Hissene Habre and Libyan forces.
