	<field name = "BODY">French inflation slowed in February to
between 0.1 and 0.2 pct against 0.9 pct in January, the
National Statistics Institute (INSEE) said.
    The retail price index showed a year-on-year rise of 3.4
pct against three pct in January. An INSEE official said the
final figure for February would be released later this month.
    After January's rise the government was forced to revise
its inflation target for 1987 to 2.5 pct year on year from an
initial target of two pct, after 2.1 pct in 1986.
    Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said half the January
rise was due to higher oil prices and forecast a February
slowing.
