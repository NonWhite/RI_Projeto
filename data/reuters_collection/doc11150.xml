	<field name = "DATELINE">ARLINGTON, Va, March 30 -</field>
	<field name = "content">Smithfield Foods Inc said that on
March 27 the National Labor Relations Board issued a
consolidated complaint against its Patrick Cudahy Inc unit.
    The complaint charges that Cudahy engaged in unfair labor
practices in connection with collective bargaining negotiations
with the United Food and Commercial Workers international union
and a strike by certain Cudahy's employees. The complaint is
seeking relief as may be just and proper to remedy the unfair
labor practices.
    Cudahy denies the allegation and plans to contest the
matter vigorously at a hearing on May 11.
