	<field name = "content">The Australian government has given
support in principle to the production of platinum and silver
bullion coins at the Perth Mint, Treasurer Paul Keating said.
    This followed the success of the Australian Nugget gold
bullion coins launched this year, he said in a statement.
    He said that, as with the Australian nuggets, the coins
would be legal tender. The platinum coins would be made in four
weights but the silver coin would be of one ounce weight.
    He said detailed arrangements for their issue would be
finalised after talks between the Federal authorities and the
Western Australian government, owner of the Perth Mint.
