will market electronic data transmission equipment of its own

    The spokesman told Reuters the equipment, known as
fourth-generation modems, will be sold by Mitel Datacom Inc>,
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Canada's Mitel Corp MLT.TO>, in
which British Telecom has a controlling stake.
    He declined to comment on the volume of projected sales. He
said the modems, already available in Europe where they hold a
majority share of the market, were the first of their kind to
comply with the latest international standards.
