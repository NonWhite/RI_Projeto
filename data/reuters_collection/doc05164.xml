has assured Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi it will continue
to give his country maximum support, the official Kenya News
Agency KNA said.
    It said IMF Managing director Michel Camdessus made the
pledge during talks with Moi in Washington yesterday.
    Earlier this month, Moi told parliament Kenya would face a
difficult balance of payments situation this year as a result
of falling income from coffee exports and a higher oil import
bill.
    Foreign bankers in Nairobi have said a new loan agreement
with the IMF would be Kenya's first option for dealing with the
expected deficit.
    According to KNA, Moi thanked Camdessus for the IMF's help
to Kenya during difficult times in the past.
    "Mr Camdessus assured president Moi that the IMF would
continue to give Kenya maximum help," it added.
    Moi pressed the U.S. To increase its level of aid to Kenya,
which fell to 53 mln dlrs this year from 111 mln in 1984, and
called for more U.S. Investment in the country.
