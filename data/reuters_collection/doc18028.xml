acquire all of Carling's outstanding preferred stock.
    Elders, which owns 100 pct of Carling's outstanding common
shares, previously proposed to redeem the 433,745 Carling
series A preferred shares at 33.50 Canadian dlrs each and
redeem the 386,662 series B preferreds at 40 dlrs a share.

dividends are paid.

the bidder for Carling's preferred shares.
    On May 29, the bidder offered to acquire the Carling

series B share.
    Elders said leaving the Carling preferred shares
outstanding will not affect ongoing plans of the company.
