	<field name = "DATELINE">TAIPEI, June 18 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">The joint committee of Taiwan's soybean
importers will reopen a tender tomorrow for two shipments of
54,000 to 66,000 tonnes of U.S. Soybeans, a committee spokesman
told Reuters.
     The committee rejected a tender today for a cargo of
27,000 to 33,000 tonnes on the grounds the prices offered by
the U.S. Suppliers were too high, he said.
    The committee will be seeking a further shipment of between
27,000 and 33,000 tonnes when it reopens the tender tomorrow,
he added.
