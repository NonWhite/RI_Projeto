	<field name = "TITLE">LYNCH LGL> PLANS OFFER FOR BECOR BCW> STOCK</field>
	<field name = "DATELINE">NEW YORK, June 2 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">Lynch Corp said it will offer 10.50 dlrs
a share in cash, 4.50 dlrs in subordinated debentures and a 1/4
share in a new company for each Becor Western Inc share
outstanding.
    Lynch said its proposed offer "substantially improves" over
the offer of 10.45 dlrs a share in cash and 4.00 dlrs of senior
sinking fund debentures made by BCW Acquisition Inc, formed by
Becor's management.
    Lynch Chairman Mario Gabelli, who heads a group which owns
12.35 pct of Becor's 16.5 mln outstanding shares, said the
Lynch bid "is about one dlr better than the present offer."
   
    Gabelli previously said in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission he felt the Becor managment buyout was
unfar.
    The Lynch officer said he was invited by other Becor
shareholders to make an offer.
    Following sale of Becor's aerospace subsidiary in February,
the management group led by President William Winter announced
plans for a 238.1 mln dlr leveraged buyout. was planning to
take Becor for about 238.1 mln dlrs.  A shareholder vote on the
buyout offer is scheduled for June four.
