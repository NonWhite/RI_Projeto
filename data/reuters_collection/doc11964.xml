Department (ECGD) said it would change the system of premiums
it levies from British exporters, reducing their costs when
they tender for a contract abroad.
    It said in a statement that the changes involved halving
the rate of non-refundable premiums levied by the ECGD from
exporters before the contract they tender for is allocated. The
rates of additional premium paid by successful tenderers will
rise.
 The last overhaul in premiums was in 1984 when charges for
cover rose sharply after several years of heavy losses.
