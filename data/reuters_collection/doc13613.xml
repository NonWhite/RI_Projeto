	<field name = "DATELINE">NEW YORK, April 7 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">CBS Inc said under its settlement with
former chairman and chief executive officer Thomas Wyman, it
will pay him 400,000 dlrs a year for life.
    CBS, in a proxy statement, said Wyman can also elect to
receive either 3,800,000 dlrs in 10 annual installments or a
lump sum of 2,800,000 dlrs next January Two.
    The settlement with Wyman called for his employment to
continue through 1986, and he was paid 809,654 dlrs in base
salary and 293,859 dlrs in bonuses for the year, CBS said, with
the bonuses paid in February 1987.
    Wyman resigned on September 10 amid opposition from the
company's two largest shareholders, Loews Corp LTR> chairman
Laurence A. Tisch and retired CBS chairman William S. Paley.
Tisch was then named chief executive officer and Paley returned
as chairman.
    The proxy statement said Tisch will receive a salary of
750,000 dlrs for serving as chief executive this year.
