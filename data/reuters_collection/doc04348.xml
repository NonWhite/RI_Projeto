(ICO) executive board meeting scheduled for the end of this
month has been delayed by one day and will now run from March
31 to April 2 and not March 30 to April 1, ICO officials said.
    On March 30, the ICO ad hoc working group will meet to
consider management consultants Ernst  Whinney's report on the
ICO secretariat. This report was commissioned late last year to
report on the administrative structure of the ICO.
