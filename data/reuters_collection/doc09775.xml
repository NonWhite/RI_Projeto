	<field name = "BODY">Libyan forces appear to be
withdrawing from their last stronghold in Chad after suffering
defeats at the hands of French-backed government troops,
according to officials in both the U.S. And France.
    In Washington, a State Department spokesman told reporters
"we have no reason to doubt that Libyan forces are leaving Faya
Largeau," Libya's main garrison in Chad.
    The French Defence Ministry said it could not confirm the
departure of the Libyan troops, but an official said "it is
extremely likely. They are deprived of air cover and supplies,
and their morale must be zero."
