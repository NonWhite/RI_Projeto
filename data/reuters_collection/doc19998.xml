	<field name = "DATELINE">TOKYO, Oct 20 -</field>
	<field name = "content">Canon Inc CANN.T> said it will stop making
Japanese language word processors with retail prices below
50,000 yen and consign production instead to Kyushu Matsushita
Electronic Co Ltd>, a 51.75-pct owned unit of Matsushita
Electric Industrial Co Ltd MC.T>.
    A Canon spokesman said the move reflects intense price
competition as Canon, Casio Computer Co Ltd CACT.T> and others
compete in the growing market for low-end processors.
    Canon will focus production on more expensive and
sophisticated models which have more generous profit margins,
he said.
