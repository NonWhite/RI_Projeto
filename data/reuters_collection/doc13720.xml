Inc said it expects its fully diluted earnings per share for
the first quarter to be about 35 pct above the same year-ago
period.
    It also looks for 1987 full-year fully diluted earnings to
be about 20 pct higher than the record 4.31 dlrs a share
reported for 1986.
    Chairman Donald Clark, in remarks prepared for delivery to
New York security analysts, cited increased earnings from
Household Financial Services and "excellent return on equity
from Household Manufacturing, combined with the impact of our
share repurchase program, will result in higher earnings per
share and improved return on equity in 1987."
