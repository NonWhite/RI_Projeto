	<field name = "BODY">Royal Bank of Canada> said it is
raising its U.S. base lending rate by 1/4 pct to 8-1/4 pct,

    The move is the first change in the bank's U.S. dollar base
lending rate since last August, when it lowered the rate 1/2
point.
    It follows the announcement yesterday of a 1/4 point rise
to 7-3/4 pct of two of the largest U.S. banks' prime rates.
