	<field name = "BODY">General Public Utilities corp
said its Three Mile Island Unit One's power output has been cut
to 81 pct of reactor power, or 730 megawatts of electricity,
due to mineral deposits on the secondary or non-nuclear side of
its two steam generators.
    The company said the deposits do not affect the safe
operation of the plant but interfere with the production of
steam.
    It said the unit was similarly limited in power in late
1985.
