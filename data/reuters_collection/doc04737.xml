	<field name = "BODY">The Liberal party easily won the Truro
by-election with almost twice as many votes as its nearest
rival, the Press Association news agency reported.
    The poll in the South-West of England constituency was
called after the death of the previous member of parliament,
also a member of the Liberal party.
    Matthew Taylor raised the Liberal majority by winning
30,599 votes. Conservative Nicholas St Aubyn was second with
15,982 while Labour candidate John King polled 3,603.
    The last by-election, in the London suburb of Greenwich,
was won by the Social Democrat-Liberal alliance.
