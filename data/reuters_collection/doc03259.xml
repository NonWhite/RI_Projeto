said its planned offering later this week of 670 mln dlrs of
Series 62 bonds would probably be the last time it taps the
market until the third quarter.
    The bonds will be sold by a syndicate led by Salomon
Brothers Inc. Their maturity will be set at the pricing.
    Proceeds will be used to redeem all outstanding Series 50,
53 and 54 bonds, each with final maturities of 2008 and bearing
interest at 10 pct, 9-7/8 pct and 9-3/8 pct. Municipal
Assistance said it will buy back at 102 the Series 50 bonds in
July 1994 and the Series 53 and 54 bonds in July 1995.
