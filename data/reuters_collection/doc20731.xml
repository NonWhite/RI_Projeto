	<field name = "DATELINE">FAIRFAX, Va., Oct 20 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">TRW Inc said it was selected to
perform fact-finding security system surveys for the authority
that is building Kansai International Airport in Osaka, Japan.
    The company said the 340,000 dlr contract was significant
because it was the first contract issued by the authority
solely to an American company without Japanese partners.
    The contract calls for TRW to perform studies of other
international airport security systems on behalf of Kansai, the
company said.
    Kansai is scheduled to be operational in 1993.
