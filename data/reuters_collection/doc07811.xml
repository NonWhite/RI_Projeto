	<field name = "BODY">Duff and Phelps today raised the
ratings on General Public Utilities' Pennsylvania Electric Co.
subsidiary fixed income securities.
    First mortgage bonds and collateralized pollution control
revenue bonds have been raised to DP-6 (middle A) from DP-7
(low A), debentures raised to DP-7 from DP-8 (high BBB), and
preferred stock raised to DP-8 from DP-9 (middle BBB).
    About 766 mln dlrs of debt is affected.
    The upgrade reflects general improvement in the company's
