Minister Renato Archer said Brazil will keep its computer
market closed to foreign goods in order to give its own infant
industry time to develop.
    "Every country establishes laws to protect its interests.
The United States closed their borders at a certain stage to
some foreign goods and therefore protected its industrial
development. Now it is time for Brazil to do likewise," Archer
said at the opening of a national software conference.
    After several meetings, Brazil and the U.S. Have made no
major progress in their computer row, which they have been
trying to resolve for the past 18 months.
    The Reagan administration has objected to Brazil protecting
its computer industry from imports.
