	<field name = "DATELINE">WASHINGTON, June 15 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">President Reagan today sent a
classified report to Congress on his plan to protect Kuwaiti
oil tankers with U.S. military escorts.
    Congressional officials said the report, received by House
Speaker Jim Wright and Senate majority leader Robert Byrd, will
not be made public.
    Congress has demanded a detailed security plan on how U.S.
warships and servicemen would be protected from possible attack
in the Gulf region, scene of the prolonged war between Iran and
Iraq.
    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
Administration intended to push ahead with the plan despite
strong opposition in Congress.
    He said the report to Congress provided a comprehensive
overview of Administration strategy in the Gulf, adding the
military escort plan would begin "when the President was
satisfied that all preparations had been completed
satisfactorily".
    Fitzwater did not say when this might be, but denied the
protection plan was being held up.
