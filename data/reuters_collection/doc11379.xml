	<field name = "DATELINE">WASHINGTON, March 31 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., predicted
the Reagan administration within the next ten days to two weeks
will offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union under the
Export Enhancement Program, EEP.
    Roberts made the comment at a press conference held by
Republican members of the House Agriculture Committee.
    He did not say on what he based the comment, but an aide
said Roberts had been in touch with top Republican officials
recently.
    The possibility of an expansion of EEP to include wheat to
Moscow has been rumored for some time, and some industry
sources believe a decision on the issue will be made by the
Reagan administration before Secretary of State George Shultz
goes to Moscow in April.
