said it plans to discontinue marketing its gate array
integrated circuit product line and focus efforts on the market
for field-programmable products.
    It said the current market dynamics will hinder
profitability in the gate array market for some time.
    Monolithic also said it does not expect the move to have a
negative impact on earnings, adding, the company has estimated
that the gate array products would have contributed only one
pct of revenues in fiscal 1987.
