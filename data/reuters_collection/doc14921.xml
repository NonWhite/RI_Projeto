	<field name = "BODY">Good rains of one to four inches in the
past 10 days have boosted moisture-stressed sugar cane crops in
the Mackay-Burdekin region of Queensland's central coast, an
Australian Sugar Producers' Association spokesman said.
    As previously reported, the region has been undergoing a
severe dry spell, partly relieved by scattered rainfall, since
December, following the virtual failure of the summer wet
season.
    Mills in the area have been reporting that their crops are
beginning to look healthy and greener and are putting on growth
since the rains began, the spokesman said from Brisbane.
    Although the Mackay-Burdekin crop outlook is much better
than it was, there will be some cane losses, the spokesman
said. But is too early to say what they will be and more rain
is needed to restore sub-soil moisture.
    Elsewhere, in far north Queensland, the Bundaberg region
and southern Queensland, the cane is in excellent condition and
some mills are forecasting record crops, he said.
    Initial 1987 crop estimates will probably be compiled
towards the end of May, he said.
    The cane crush normally runs from June to December.
