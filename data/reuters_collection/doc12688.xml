	<field name = "BODY">Jorge Cardenas, manager of Colombia's
Coffee Growers' Federation, welcomed Brazil's export measures
and said they clarified the market situation.
    He told journalists the measures "set the rules clearly" and
helped dissipate whatever doubts the market might have had
about the world's biggest exporter's policies.
    Brazil's coffee institute, IBC, today opened export
registrations for May with no quantity limit set. The
contribution quota will be 15 pct of the minimum registration
price, which will vary daily.
