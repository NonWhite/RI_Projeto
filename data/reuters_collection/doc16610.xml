	<field name = "TITLE">AMERICAN CENTURY ACT> RESTATES EARNINGS</field>
	<field name = "DATELINE">SAN ANTONIO, Tex., April 13 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">American Century Corp said it
has restated its earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30,
1986 to provide an additional five mln dlrs to its loan loss
allowance, causing a restated year-end net loss of 14,937,000
dlrs, instead of 9,937,000 dlrs.
    The company said the change came after talks with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on the company's judgement
in considering the five mln dlrs collectible.
    In the note to its 1986 financial statement, American
Century said it considered the five mln dlrs collectible,
making its loan loss provision less than required.
    The company said in spite of the SEC decision, it still
feels its allowance for possible loan losses at June 30, 1986
was adequate and that it has considered all relevant
information to determine the collectibility of the five mln dlr
receivable.
    But, it said continued disagreement with the SEC staff
would not be in its best interest.
