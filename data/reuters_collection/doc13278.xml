said it and four other firms jointly concluded negotiations to
export a total of over 400,000 tonnes of seamless pipes in the
six months to end-September to China and the Soviet Union.
    Export prices for that period for both countries were set
100 to 150 yen per tonne higher than previous contracted prices
due to the yen's gains against the dollar, it said.
    Contracted export volume for China is likely to be over
200,000 tonnes against 350,000 for Oct 1986-March 1987, and
420,000 for April-Sept 1986, and for the Soviet Union over
200,000 tonnes. No direct Soviet comparison was available.
