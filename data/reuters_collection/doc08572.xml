	<field name = "BODY">Republicans apparently have ended
their vote boycott at the budget drafting sessions of the House
Budget Committee.
    House Budget Committee Chairman William Gray, a Democrat,
announced that Republicans now would like to join in the effort
to write a budget, but behind closed doors.
    Last week, Republicans refused to vote on any budget issues
contending they had been left out of the process.
    The committee plans to meet tomorrow on a budget and Gray
said he welcomes the "good faith effort" of the minority
Republicans.
