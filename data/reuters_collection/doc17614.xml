	<field name = "BODY">The White House said President Reagan
had made no decision on whether to reappoint Paul Volcker as
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board when Volcker's term
expires in August.
    "No decision has been made on chairman Volcker ... He has
not discussed this with the president, and no decision has been
made one way or another," White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said.
    Asked if Reagan would discuss the issue with Volcker before
leaving for the Venice summit on Wednesday, Fitzwater said, "I
have no idea."
