(Alusuisse) plans further drastic cuts in its aluminium
smelting capacity and more concentration of higher value-added
products, chief executive Hans Jucker said.
    Elaborating on plans disclosed in outline last September,
company officials said current smelting capacity of 390,000
tonnes a year would be cut to between 250,000 and 260,000
tonnes by 1989 or 1990. They did not say where cuts might be
made.
    Two years ago, before selling its Ormet Corp subsidiary in
the United States to local management and staff, Alusuisse had
an annual capacity of 800,000 tonnes.
