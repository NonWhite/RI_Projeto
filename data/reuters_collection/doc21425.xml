	<field name = "DATELINE">WASHINGTON, Oct 19 -</field>
	<field name = "content">The Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (CFTC) said the Kansas City Board of Trade's (KCBT)
one-minute audit trail system was adequate and accurate.
    But in its second rule enforcement review of an exchange's
audit trail system, CFTC said KCBT needed to provide a more
accurate indication of the percent of trades that meet the
one-minute timing standard.
    CFTC also recommended the exchange develop a computerized
program to compare time and sales prints to the record of
trades in its trade register.
