	<field name = "BODY">Michael Krupp, a Golden, Colo.,
businessman and major shareholder of Kappa Networks Inc, said
he and Kappa's management are considering seeking a merger
between Kappa and Radiation Systems Inc.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Krupp said companies he controls and Kappa acquired a combined
292,000 Radiation System shares, or 5.25 pct of the total.
    Krupp, who has a 24.4 pct stake in Kappa, said he and Kappa
management believe a Kappa-Radiation Systems combination would
be good for both companies. But no decision has been made on
whether or how to proceed with a merger attempt, he added.
