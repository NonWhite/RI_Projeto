	<field name = "DATELINE">ROME, March 19 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">Italy's overall balance of payments showed
a surplus of 1,461 billion lire in February 1987 compared with
a deficit of 1,145 billion in January, provisional Bank of
Italy figures show.
    The February surplus compared with a deficit of 1,578
billion lire in the same month for 1986.
    For the first two months of 1987, the balance of payments
showed a surplus of 302 billion lire against a deficit of 4,622
billion in the same 1986 period.
    The Bank of Italy said the cumulative balance for the first
two months of 1987 does not match the total calculated on the
individual monthly figures because of the provisional nature of
certain data.
