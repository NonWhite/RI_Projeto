said 344 members of the United Paperworkers International Union
went on strike at the Snowflake, Ariz., paper mill, halting
operations at the newsprint and linerboard facility.
    The mill, which employs 525 people, has an annual capacity
of 282,000 tons of newsprint and 159,000 tons of linerboard,
the company said.
    Southwest Forest said it is negotiating with the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, whose 65
members are honoring the paperworkers' picket lines.
    The company said it intends to resume mill operations as
quickly as possible using salaried employees, union workers who
elect to work, contractors and newly hired replacements for the
striking workers.
