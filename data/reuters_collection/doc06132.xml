	<field name = "DATELINE">MADRID, March 17 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">Hundreds of farmers brought Madrid's
traffic to a standstill with their tractors in the latest
protest to demand a better deal from the European Community
(EC) and more government subsidies to face up to EC
competition.
    Farmers said they had planned to bring their cows with them
but police had prevented their entry into the capital.
    In the south, striking shipyard workers clashed with police
in the port of Cadiz in what has become a regular weekly
protest against job layoffs at the state-owned Astilleros
Espanoles. The workers locked themselves in the factory and
traded stones for tear gas, police said.
