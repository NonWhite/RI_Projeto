	<field name = "TITLE">UNICLUB IN JOINT VENTURE</field>
	<field name = "DATELINE">NEW YORK, April 13 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">Uniclub Inc said it has agreed to form
an equally-owned joint venture called Uniclub Marketing Inc
with Goodway Marketing Inc.
    The company said Uniclub Marketing will use narrowcast
cable television, including Goodway's Video Shopping Mall
television shopping program, to sell Uniclub memberships, add
new participating merchants and sell Uniclob licenses and
franchises.
    The company said it expects the new program will give it
enough cardholders, merchants and fee income to make Uniclub
solidly profitable by year-end.  Uniclub markets a consumer
charge card that gives members a 15 pct reduction on monthly
billing for all retail purchases.
