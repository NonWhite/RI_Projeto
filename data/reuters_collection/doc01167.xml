	<field name = "DATELINE">RICHARDSON, Texas, March 3 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">Electrospace Systems Inc said
it was ordered by the U.S. Army to immediately proceed with the
design and production of a computer-based control system for
the army's tactical voice and data communications network, in a
contract potentially worth 101 mln dlrs.
    It said the order followed a favorable ruling by the
General Accounting Office on two protests that earlier caused a
stop work order on the 26.8 mln dlr contract, awarded last
September. It said that order covers 59 mobile shelter-based
systems and 44 remote terminals, with options for 279 mobile
units and 178 remote units for a total of 101 mln dlrs.
