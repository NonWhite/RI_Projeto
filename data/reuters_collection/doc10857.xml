said its Hyland Therapeutics unit has started the first human
clinical trials on genetically engineered Factor VIII, the
clotting agent missing from the blood of most hemophiliacs.
    It said unlike Factor VIII concentrates currently in use,
genetically engineered Factor VIII would not be limited by the
availability of human plasma and will be completely free from
blood-borne viruses, including AIDS and all forms of hepatitis,
Baxter said.
    Baxter also said it is in the final states of U.S. clinical
trials on a highly purified form of Factor VIII derived from
human plasma that is produced using an advanced process
incorporating monoclonal antibody purification.
    It said Genetics Institute, a publicly held biotechnology
company in which Baxter is a shareholder, will supply the
protein used for human clinical testing, as well as a
substantial portion of ongoing production requirements.
