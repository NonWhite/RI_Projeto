	<field name = "TITLE">SPANISH FARMERS BLOCK ROADS IN EC PROTEST</field>
	<field name = "DATELINE">MADRID, March 13 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">Spanish farmers took their tractors to
the roads today and blocked a border crossing with France in a
protest against the Socialist government's EC policies,
officials said.
    Protestors set cars ablaze and cut off traffic in the Rioja
wine growing district, while they blocked roads with tractor
convoys in other northern regions such as Saragossa, where
5,000 farmers joined the demonstrations.
    Farmers blockaded the border crossing with France at La
Junquera near Barcelona, refusing to allow lorries from other
European countries to enter Spain.
    Spanish farmers have been protesting for the past two weeks
to demand a better deal within the Community. The farm protest
came in the wake of demonstrations last night in over 30 cities
in which workers marched for wage rises and against job losses.
    But the turnout, regarded as a dress rehearsal for a
general strike next month, disappointed the communist-led
Workers Commissions union organisers. The ruling Socialist
Party's trade union arm, the General Workers' Union, did not
join in.
    More than 20 strikes are planned for this month and next in
the transport sector, with stoppages at the state-owned Iberia
and Aviaco airlines and RENFE railways.
