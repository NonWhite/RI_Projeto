	<field name = "content">A senior Brazilian debt negotiator,
Antonio de Padua Seixas, has offered to resign from his post as
Director for External Debt Management at the Central Bank, a
bank spokesman said.
    The spokesman told Reuters by telephone from Brasilia that
Seixas had offered to resign last week but the government had
not yet responded.
    Seixas, who has played a leading role in negotiations with
creditors over Brazil's 109 billion dlr foreign debt, is not
attending current debt discussions in Miami.
    Brazil is talking to bank creditors at Miami during a
meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank, its first
discussions with these creditors since it suspended interest
payments last month on its 68 billion dlr debt to commercial
banks.
    The Central Bank spokesman said he did not know why Seixas
wanted to leave his job.
