	<field name = "content">Treasury Secretary James Baker said
that some of the trade bills proposed by Congress conflict
significantly with certain basic principles the Reagan
administration considers critical.
    Baker told a Senate committee that the administration would
resist such measures as a general import surcharge,
sector-specific protection such as import quotas for individual
products, mandatory retaliation, and limits on presidential
discretion in negotiating more open markets abroad and other
trade steps.
