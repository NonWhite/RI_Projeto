downgraded to CCC-plus from single-B Del E. Webb Corp's DWP>
30 mln dlrs of outstanding subordinated debt.
    It said the issue was removed from Creditwatch, where it
was placed on July 27 due to the deteriorating operating
performance at Webb's minority owned and managed Atlantic City

earnings and cash flow prospects and Webb's resultant weakened
