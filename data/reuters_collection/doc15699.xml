	<field name = "TITLE">GENCORP GY> EXTENDS SHAREHOLDER RIGHT PLAN</field>
	<field name = "DATELINE">AKRON, Ohio, April 9 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">GenCorp Inc said its board extended
to April 13 the date the rights issued under the company's
shareholder rights plan will trade separately from the common
stock.
    The company said the plan, originally adopted February 18,
has been extended several times since its adoption.
    GenCorp said the rights plan makes it more difficult for an
outside company or person to takeover the company. The plan has
been extended indefinitely and to no person acquiring 20 pct or
more of the common stock prior to April 13, the company said.
    The plan calls for the attachment of one preferred stock
purchase right to each common share outstanding.
   On Monday, GenCorp announced it will buy up to 54 pct of its
own outstanding common shares for 130 dlrs per share. It said
details of the plan will be announced by the end of the week.
