	<field name = "BODY">Senate Banking committee chairman
William Proxmire, D-Wis, said a conference will be held with
the House Banking committee next week on a bill to refinance
the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
    The Senate has passed a 7.5 billion dlr FSLIC refinancing,
while the House approved five billion dlrs in new funds. The
Senate bill also bars new bank services until next March and
bans so-called non-bank banks, provisions the House opposes.
    FSLIC is virtually out of money to help ailing thrift
institutions, according to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
