	<field name = "content">British Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson pledged to continue making defeat of
inflation a top priority.
    Speaking to the ruling Central Council of the Conservative
Party, Lawson said "We will continue to make defeat of inflation
a top priority until it is eliminated altogether."
    Year on year inflation is running at 3.7 pct.
    Lawson said that under the government's program of selling
off state industries to the private sector the number of share-
holders in the country had trebled since 1979 and now
represented one in five of the adult population.
