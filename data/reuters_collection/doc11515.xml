	<field name = "BODY">Snow and cold weather stressed
livestock in the northern and Central plains and Rocky Mountain
States in the week ended March 29, the Joint Agricultural
Weather Facility of the U.S. Agriculture and Commerce
Departments said.
    In a summary of its weekly Weather and Crop Bulletin, the
agency said in Colorado, calving and lambing continued, but
young animals were under stress.
    Ranchers were busy digging out and locating stray livestock
in Kansas and North Dakota, it said.
    Heavy snowfall and cold gusty wind caused some cattle
deaths in the Panhandle area of Oklahoma.
    The cold weather slowed pasture growth from Texas to North
Dakota, the agency said.
    Pastures continued responding to moisture and warm
temperatures in most other areas, it said.
