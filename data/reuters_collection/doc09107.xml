	<field name = "DATELINE">SAN DIEGO, Calif., March 24 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">PS Group Inc said it and
USAir Group agreed to move up the completion date of USAir's
acquisition of Pacific Southwest Airlines to April 30 from
September 30 originally.
    If the acquisition does not take place by April 30, either
party may terminate the agreement, the company said.
    The deadline has been moved up because the Department of
Transportation and PS Group shareholders have already approved
the transaction, the company said.
    A Teamsters Union agreement to certain labor contract
conditions remains to be resolved under the pact.
