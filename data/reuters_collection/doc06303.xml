	<field name = "BODY">Pfizer Inc said it expects to file a
new drug application in the U.S. and in other markets this year
for sertraline, a treatment for depression.
    In its annual report, Pfizer said that in addition to the
drug's anti-depressant action, sertraline is currently
undergoing studies to explore its ability to promote weight
loss. Company officials were not immediately available to
comment further.
    Eli Lilly and Co's LLY> Prozac, an antidepressant awaiting
marketing approval, has shown promise in promoting weight loss.
    Pfizer also said it plans to file for U.S. marketing
approval for certrizine, a "novel" antihistamine for hay fever,
and other allergic reactions.
    In 1986, Pfizer earned 660 mln dlrs or 3.90 dlrs per share
on revenues of 4.5 billion dlrs.
