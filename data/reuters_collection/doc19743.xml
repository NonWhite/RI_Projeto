	<field name = "BODY">Maxtor Corp said it bought
privately-held Storage Dimensions Inc for an undisclosed sum.
    The company said Storage Dimensions incorporates Maxtor's
high-capacity 5-1/4-inch Winchester and optical disk drives
into a family of data storage subsystems for IBM PCs, XTs, ATs
and compatibles.
    Storage Dimensions is the creator or SpeedStor software, a
utility program that integrates high-capacity disk drives into
PCs.
    Maxtor said the purchase reflects its desire to compete in
the high-capacity segment of the PC market.
