	<field name = "content">The European Commission is to consider
proposed new higher minimum standards for sales of durum wheat
into intervention stores, European Community sources said.
    They said a document drawn up by Commission officials
proposes a reduction in the maximum humidity level to 13 pct
from 14, an increase in the minimum weight to 78 kilos per
hectolitre from 76, a tightening of other technical standards
and introduction of some new ones.
    Current public stocks of durum wheat in the EC are 1.15 mln
tonnes, of which almost 1.12 mln are in Italy.
