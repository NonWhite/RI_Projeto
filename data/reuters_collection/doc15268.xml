	<field name = "DATELINE">MINNETONKA, MINN., April 8 -</field>
	<field name = "content">Minnetonka Inc said that
neither its Foltene hair treatment nor its European supplier,
Crinos Industria Farmacobiologica SpA, are named or involved in
action filed by Upjohn Co.
    Earlier today, Upjohn said it filed a complaint with the
International Trade Commission requesting an investigation of
infringement of its patent for the drug, Minoxidil, used in its
treatment for baldness.
    Minnetonka said it decided to make a statement to "dispell
any association it may be involved" with the suit. Foltene does
not use compositions of Minoxidil, it said.
