	<field name = "DATELINE">VINELAND, N.J., March 25 -</field>
	<field name = "content">ImmunoGenetics Inc said it has
entered the liposome technology field through its majority
owned subsidiary, Molecular Packaging Systems Inc.
    Liposomes are small sacks of lipid, or fat, membranes
arranged in layers like an onion. These sacks can carry a
variety of agents that are released over a period of time into
the body as the onion-like layers break down.
    It said Molecular has developed a versatile low-cost method
for encapsulating a broad range of health care and industrial
products, including human hemoglobin which transports oxygen in
the blood.
    Immunogenetics also said Molecular's liposomes, called
Micropak, can carry more than five times the amount of
particles than conventional liposomes.
    The company also said its technology for encapsulating
hemoglobin may prove helpful in preventing the spread of
hepatitis and the AIDS virus in blood transfusions as all
viruses and foreign agents are moved during preparation of the
hemogloblin.
