	<field name = "BODY">The Manitoba Agriculture Department
weekly crop report said no measurable precipitation was
reported across the province in the past week, allowing small
grain seedings to progress rapidly across the south, with field
preparation under way in the northern growing regions.
    Small grains should be seeded across the Province in one to
two weeks, assuming weather remains dry.
    Planting progress was most advanced in the southeast, with
30 pct of the spring wheat acres and 40 pct of the barley acres
seeded. Cereals plantings were well under way in the south
central part of the province, with seedings spotty so far in
the southwest.
    Summer fallow acres should be in line with the latest
Statistics Canada projections, the report said.
