	<field name = "content">An official of Boeing Co said the company
would not be handing out any "give-away" deals under its
commitment to provide business worth 4.4 billion francs to
French firms over eight years.
    The U.S. Aircraft maker agreed last month to grant
so-called "offset" contracts equivalent to 130 pct of the cost of
France's purchase of three AWACS radar early warning planes.
    "I would like to stress the need for competitiveness," said
Lee Hessler, Business Manager for Boeing Aerospace Co's
Information Systems Division.
