	<field name = "content">Fujitsu Ltd ITSU.T> has developed a
simulation processor which will operate faster than any
computer and will speed development of the next generation of
computers, a spokesman told Reuters.
    The simulation processor will halve the time needed for
fault testing the millions of basic logic circuits incorporated
in the latest computers, he said.
    It can simulate the operation of as many as 530 mln logic
elements a second if a maximum of 64 processors are
interconnected. The simulation processor, which took four years
to develop, will not be marketed, he said.
