Fitzwater said President Reagan's record in opposing tax hikes
is "long and strong" and not about to change.
    "We're opposed to tax increases.... We will fight tax
increases.... We will deal with it politically in every forum
possible," said Fitzwater when questioned about whether there
was any change in the administration's position.
    Fitzwater said Reagan's strong feelings against a tax hike
included opposition to an oil import fee.
    "The President's position is that he is opposed to it," he
said.
