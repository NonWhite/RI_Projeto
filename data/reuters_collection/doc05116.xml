statement that he was disappointed in Caesars World Inc's
response to his 28 dlrs a share offer to buy the company.
    The company had said the offer was inadequate and that it
was exploring restructuring or sale of the company to another

shareholders. "My primary desire is still to sit down with
management to negotiate a friendly acquisition," he said.
