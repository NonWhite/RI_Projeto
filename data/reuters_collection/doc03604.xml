	<field name = "BODY">TENERA LP said it will make an
initial quarterly distribution of 17 cts per unit on April 15
to holders of record March 31.
    The partnership said the dividend is greater than it had
expectd to pay and was warranted by fourth quarter results and
anticipated results for this year's first quarter.
    TENERA said it expects a comparable distribution for the
second quarter.  It said about 13 cts per share of the first
quarter amount will be taxable income.
