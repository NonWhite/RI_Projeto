	<field name = "DATELINE">DALLAS, Oct. 19 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">U.S. bank executives said if the
precipitous fall in the stock market continued it could force
banks to demand more collateral on stock loans and hurt
consumer borrowing.
    But the leaders of the American Bankers Association, which
is holding its annual convention, said the drop was probably
only temporary and the market would eventually recover because
of the strength of the economy.
    "The underlying basics of the economy are still strong,"
Mark Olson, president of the ABA, the largest U.S. bankers
group, said.
