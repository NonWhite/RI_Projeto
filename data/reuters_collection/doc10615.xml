	<field name = "content">Zimbabwe has confirmed an outbreak of
the animal-borne hoof-and-mouth disease, which prompted
Botswana on Thursday to stop imports of almost all Zimbabwean
meat products.
    Agriculture Ministry Permanent Secretary Robbie Mupawose
said it had been found at a ranch in southwestern Matabeleland
province and that all measures were being taken to contain it
from spreading. "The effect of this outbreak on Zimbabwe's beef
exports is being examined," he added in a statement.
    Zimbabwe exports a wide range of meat products to
neighbouring states and some 8,000 tonnes of high-grade beef to
the European Community annually worth about 48 mln U.S. Dlrs.
