development of a five billion dlr hydroelectric power project
in Sarawak, East Malaysia, until the economy improves, deputy
Minister of Energy, Telecoms and Post Zainal Abidin Zin said.
    He told reporters a shortage of funds forced the government
to shelve the project, which involved building several dams and
a 20,000 megawatt capacity undersea cable.
    Malaysia originally planned to export electricity generated
by the project to Singapore, Brunei and Indonesia by 2000 if
the project could be started before 1996, Zainal said.
