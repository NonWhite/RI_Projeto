	<field name = "content">The U.S. and the European Community could
enter into a new trade dispute unless urgent action is taken to
explain EC farm policy to the U.S. Congress, French official
sources said.
    They said Prime Minister Jacques Chirac planned to urge EC
Commission president Jacques Delors to send a team of experts
to Washington as soon as possible.
    Chirac returned to Paris this morning after three days of
talks in New York and Washington in which trade and
protectionism featured prominently.
    At the centre of the new trade tension is an EC Commission
proposal to tax vegetable oils, the sources said.
