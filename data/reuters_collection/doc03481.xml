	<field name = "DATELINE">LONDON, March 11 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">The Bank of England said it forecast a
liquidity shortage of around 300 mln stg in the market today.
    Among the main factors, the Bank said bills maturing in
official hands and the treasury bill take-up would drain 483
mln stg from the system while below target bankers' balances
and a rise in the note circulation would take out 50 mln and
100 mln stg respectively.
    Partially offsetting these, exchequer transactions would
add around 355 mln stg, the Bank added.
