said sole underwriter Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
    The debentures are convertible into the company's common

pct over the stock price when terms on the debt were set.
    Non-callable for three years, the debt is rated B-3 by

increased from an initial offering of 20 mln dlrs because of
investor demand.
