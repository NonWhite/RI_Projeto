Natural Gas Co said it filed its regularly scheduled gas cost
adjustment that will leave its rates unchanged.
    But still pending is El Paso's proposal to the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission to directly bill its wholesale
customers for deficiencies in natural gas liquid revenues.
    It said its filing called for a commodity rate of about
2.57 dlrs per dekatherm, but noted that the rate could drop to
1.84 dlrs if the Commission approves its proposal to bill
wholesale customers directly for the revenue deficiencies.
