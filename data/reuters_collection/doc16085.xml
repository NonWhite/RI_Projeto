	<field name = "DATELINE">MELBOURNE, April 10 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">Wholly-owned Mobil Corp MOB> unit,
Mobil Oil Australia Ltd>, reported a 38.63 mln dlr net loss in
1986, a turnaround from its 37.25 mln profit in 1985.
    The loss reflected a combination of strikes plus scheduled
and unscheduled refinery shutdowns for maintenance and
inventory losses caused by government controls on both crude
and product prices, Mobil said in a statement.
    However, equity-accounting of associates' profits reduced
the loss to 24 mln dlrs against a 37 mln profit in 1985.
    Mobil said it was confident 1987 would see a return to
profit as it built further on its 1985 company restructuring.
