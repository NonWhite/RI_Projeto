	<field name = "BODY">Malaysia will reduce its budget
for the 1986-1990 development plan to 49 billion ringgit from
its original 74 billion to limit expenditure, the Economic
Planning Unit (EPU) of the Prime Minister's Department said.
    EPU director-general Radin Soenarno was quoted by the
national news agency Bernama as saying this would be done by
suspending many projects which could only take off when the
recession-hit economy improved.
    Radin did not specify what projects would be suspended but
said the Fifth Malaysian Plan will be reviewed annually instead
of on a mid-term basis.
