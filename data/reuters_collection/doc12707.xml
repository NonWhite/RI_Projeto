	<field name = "DATELINE">WASHINGTON, April 2 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">The New York Mercantile Exchange,
NYMEX, has adequate trade practice surveillance and
disciplinary programs, but could take steps to improve them,
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, said.
    In a rule enforcement review, CFTC said NYMEX was able to
identify possible "violative market activity" and that
investigations were generally thorough.
    However, the commission faulted the exchange for limiting
access to its computer-assisted trade practice surveillance
system and recommended NYMEX enhance its computerized
surveillance system.
    CFTC also found NYMEX had an adequate disciplinary program,
but noted that the disciplinary process sometimes was delayed
because of failure to promptly schedule hearings.
