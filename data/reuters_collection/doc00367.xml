	<field name = "TITLE">PHILADELPHIA PORT CLOSED BY TANKER CRASH</field>
	<field name = "DATELINE">PHILADELPHIA, March 2 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">The port of Philadelphia was closed
when a Cypriot oil tanker, Seapride II, ran aground after
hitting a 200-foot tower supporting power lines across the
river, a Coast Guard spokesman said.
    He said there was no oil spill but the ship is lodged on
rocks opposite the Hope Creek nuclear power plant in New
Jersey.
    He said the port would be closed until today when they
hoped to refloat the ship on the high tide.
    After delivering oil to a refinery in Paulsboro, New
Jersey, the ship apparently lost its steering and hit the power
transmission line carrying power from the nuclear plant to the
state of Delaware.
