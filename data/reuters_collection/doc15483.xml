production workers represented by the multi-union Pacific Coast
Metal Trades District Council at its San Francisco division
struck on April Six.
    It said negotiations are expected to resume at the end of
this month.
    Todd also said the collective bargaining division in effect
at its Galveston Division expires April 17, and negotiations
with the Galveston Metal Trades Council are continuing.
    The company said results of balloting on a new collective
bargaining agreement proposal in its Seattle Division are
expected to be tabulated at the close of business tomorrow.
    The Pacific Coast Council has recommended acceptance of
that proposal by membership, Todd said.
