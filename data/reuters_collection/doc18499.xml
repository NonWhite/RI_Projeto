in British Columbia, Canada, agreed to cut the base price they
charge Japanese steelmakers to 91.77 Canadian dlrs a tonne FOB
for the year from April 1, down 14 dlrs from 1986/87, an
official at a company involved in the deal said.

Mining Corp Ltd> and Nissho Iwai Coal Development (Canada)
Ltd>.

to improve the quality of Bull Moose coal's ash specification.
