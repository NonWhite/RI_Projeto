	<field name = "BODY">A total 118,350 tonnes of current series
white sugar received export rebates of a maximum 46.496
European Currency Units (Ecus) per 100 kilos at today's
European Community (EC) tender, the U.K. Intervention Board
said.
    Out of this, traders in the U.K. Received 37,800 tonnes, in
France 34,500, in West Germany 20,000, in Belgium 18,500, in
Spain 5,800 and in Denmark 1,750 tonnes, it added.
    Earlier today, London traders had declined to give a
projected view on the level of subsidy although some said total
tonnage awards would be around 60,000 tonnes.
    Paris traders foresaw between 60,000 and 100,000 tonnes
being authorised for export at a 46.40/46.50 Ecu subsidy.
    Cumulative sales authorisations for the current season
(1986/87) now stand at 2,194,970 tonnes (43 weeks).
    Last week saw 102,350 tonnes whites authorised for export
under licences to end-Sep at the higest ever rebate of 46.864
European Currency Units (Ecus) per 100 kilos.
