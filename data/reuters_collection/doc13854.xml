	<field name = "TITLE">CBT SOYPRODUCT FUTURES EXPECTED STEADY/EASIER</field>
	<field name = "DATELINE">CHICAGO, April 6 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">CBT soyproduct futures were called
steady to slightly easier in sympathy with expected weakness in
soybeans, traders said.
    Soybean crush ratios remained under pressure yesterday, so
further decline in the U.S. soybean crush rate is needed before
soyproducts can begin to show strength relative to soybeans,
they added.

 Malaysian palm oil trimmed initial gains on trade-talk that
Pakistan passed on its tender for 6,000 tonnes of PBD palm
oil...Rotterdam vegetable oils were steady to slightly firmer
at midday, with meals and feeds mixed.
