	<field name = "BODY">United Medical Corp said it
it has requested a meeting of holders of its Swiss Francs 30
mln 5-1/8 pct convertible subordinated notes due 1991.
    The meeting has been requested in order to amend the
negative pledge and financial covenants which have proved to be
too restrictive in light of the company's activities, it said.
    United also said it plans to acquire some of these notes to
reduce its exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations.
