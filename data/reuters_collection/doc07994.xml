	<field name = "TITLE">LATIN NATIONS CALL FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION</field>
	<field name = "DATELINE">SAN JOSE, March 20 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">Representatives from 26 Latin American
countries ended a United Nations trade meeting here today with
a call for greater economic integration between developing and
industrialised countries.
    "(We) urge the international community to recognise the ...
difficulties which confront the region," a statement released by
the group, termed the San Jose Communique, said.
    The meeting was held under the auspices of the Latin
American Economic System, CEPAL, a United Nations affiliate,
and aimed to develop a joint regional position ahead of July's
conference in Geneva of the United Nations Conference on Trade
and Development, UNCTAD.
    The communique said Latin America's priority remained the
need for sustained economic growth and for easier terms on its
400 billion dlrs external debt.
    Within that framework the region would be pressing in
Geneva for more access to industrialised markets for its
exports and for compensatory capital inflows when world prices
for its mainly agricultural exports were low, it said.
    The communique also said the group would press for the
generalised system of preferences -- easy entry terms for
developing country exports -- to be expanded.
    UNCTAD was set up in 1964 to promote better international
trading conditions for developing countries and help raise
their standard of living.
