	<field name = "BODY">Allergan Inc, a subsidiary of
Smithkline Beckman Corp, said the U.S. District Court in New
York has ordered Bausch and Lomb Inc to immediately recall from
retail shelves all soft contact lens solutions sold under the
"HYPO-CARE" name and cease any further distribution.
    The company said the court found that HYPO-CARE was too
close to Allergan's trademark "HYDROCARE" to prevent public
confusion.
