it agreed to take a 15 pct stake in Air U.K. Ltd, a subsidiary
of British and Commonwealth Shipping Plc BCOM.L>, in a
transaction worth around two mln stg.

UK, which runs 111 flights a week to Amsterdam's Schipol
airport from nine UK cities.

preliminary talks about a KLM minority stake in Air U.K. But

attract more British feeder traffic to Amsterdam Airport.
