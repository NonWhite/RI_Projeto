	<field name = "DATELINE">WASHINGTON, March 17 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">The Senate Budget Committee, at its
first budget drafting meeting of the year, discarded President
Reagan's economic assumptions upon which he claims his budget
would show a 108 billion dlr deficit.
    In its place, the committee agreed to accept the non
partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) economic assumptions
in its deliberations for drafting a 1988 budget.
    The CBO says Reagan's budget--even if it were adopted
without change --would show a 134.4 billion dlr deficit in
fiscal 1988 and thereby miss the Gramm-Rudman budget law target
of 108 billion dlrs.
