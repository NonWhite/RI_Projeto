	<field name = "content">Treasury Secretary James Baker said
he opposes a new tax on securities transactions.
    "No," he said when asked by a reporter whether he favored
such a tax, which has been advocated by House Speaker James
Wright (D-Tex).
    He added, "Not unless you want to tax a whole bunch of
little security holders, which is not a good idea."
