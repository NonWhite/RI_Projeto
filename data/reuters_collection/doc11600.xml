eight mln sterling for food aid and emergency relief for famine
victims, the British High Commission announced.
    A high commission (embassy) statement said about 30,000
tonnes of cereals worth six mln sterling would be shipped to
Mozambique, and the first load of 20,000 tonnes was due soon.
    Britain will give one mln sterling for other disaster
relief programs and 1.3 mln sterling to relieve the plight of
Mozambican refugees, it added.
    The statement said Britain would also contribute 1.3 mln
sterling to the U.N. Refugee agency, UNHCR, for refugees in
neighbouring countries, and give 750,000 sterling to relief
agencies for food transport and distribution in Mozambique. The
British public has also raised more than one mln sterling.
