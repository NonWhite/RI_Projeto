	<field name = "DATELINE">WASHINGTON, Oct 19 -</field>
	<field name = "content">RKO General Inc, a unit of GenCorp
Inc, said it asked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
to reverse a preliminary ruling by an agency hearing officer
and let it keep its 14 broadcast licenses.
    The FCC hearing officer had recommended that all 14 of
RKO's licenses be revoked.
    "If the decision is allowed to stand, it will destroy our
right to broadcast," said William Reynolds, GenCorp chairman, in
a printed statement. "The decision was based on allegations of
misconduct that are either in error or have no bearing on our
fitness as a broadcaster."
