	<field name = "DATELINE">WASHINGTON, Oct 20 -</field>
	<field name = "content">President Reagan sent the five-year
International Natural Rubber Agreement to the Senate for
approval.
    Reagan said the accord is designed to stabilize rubber
prices without disturbing long-term market trends and to foster
expanded natural rubber supplies at reasonable prices.
    It continues a buffer stock of not more than 550,000 tonnes
established by a 197agreement. This will be used to defend a
regularly adjusted price range and will be financed equally by
importing and exporting members of the agreement.
