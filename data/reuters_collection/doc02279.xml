	<field name = "BODY">Switzerland's three major banks have
offered Argentina an extra 110.5 mln Swiss franc credit to help
finance the building of a heavy water plant there by Gebrueder
Sulzer AG SULZ.Z>, Union Bank of Switzerland, UBS said.
    The three -- UBS, Credit Suisse and Swiss Bank Corp --
provided an initial 409 mln franc credit after Argentina signed
a contract with Sulzer in 1980. The plant will supply its
nuclear power industry.
    The extra credit, provided at market rates, covers extra
costs incurred due to building delays, a UBS spokesman said.
