	<field name = "BODY">Chelsea Industries Inc said earnings for
its fiscal second quarter ended March 30 will be "sharply
lower" than the 1,414,000 dlrs or 55 cts a share it earned for
the same quarter last year.
    It also said it lowered its earnings forecasts for the
remainder of the fiscal year. In fiscal 1986, the company
earned 7,206,000 dlrs or 2.78 dlrs a share.
    The company cited intensely competitive market conditions
in its polyethelyne trash liner business and startup costs
related to its acquisition of Artisan Plastic for the reduced
earnings outlook.
