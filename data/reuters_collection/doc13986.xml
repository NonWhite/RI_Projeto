	<field name = "DATELINE">LONDON, April 7 -</field>
	<field name = "content">Gold bullion eased to an afternoon fix of
418.50 dlrs, 258.653 stg, an ounce in sympathy with lower
values on Comex, dealers said.
    The market remained fairly quiet, however, and was still
being overshadowed by silver.
 After opening slightly lower at 421.90/422.40, compared with
last night's close of 422.50/423, the market eased to a morning
fix of 419.80 as dealers traded on the gold/silver ratio,
selling gold and buying silver.
    Platinum was fixed this afternoon at 566.35 dlrs, slightly
above the morning setting of 565.75.
