	<field name = "BODY">The U.S. Economy has peaked and will slow
to a growth rate of between 2.5 pct and three pct for the
remainder of 1987, First Boston Corp Managing Director Albert
Wojnilower said.
    He told an investment conference the U.S. Economy will not
be able to sustain the 4.3 pct growth rate recorded in first
quarter gross national product.
    He said continued intermittent attacks on the U.S. Currency
could lead to a substantial rise in long term interest rates.
However, he predicted that rates will eventually decline either
in anticipation of a recession or because of one.
