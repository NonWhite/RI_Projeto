	<field name = "BODY">British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey
Howe backed the United States' attack on an Iranian oil
platform on Monday and said it should not worsen the Gulf
crisis.
    "The United States is fully entitled to take military action
in exercise of rights of self-defense, in the face of the
imminent threat of further attacks," Howe said in a statement
issued in London.
    The United States said its forces destroyed the platform on
Monday in retaliation for an Iranian missile attack on a U.S.-
flagged Kuwaiti ship last Friday.
    Referring to that attack, Howe added, "I trust the Iranians
will fully understand that continued attacks of this kind will
only enhance justification for firm action in self-defense."
    At a press conferenced in Luxembourg during a meeting of
European Community (EC) ministers, Howe was asked about
statements from a senior Iranian official who said America was
now involved in a full-scale war.
    "It would be profoundly undesirable and quite unjustified
for Iran to react in that way," he said.
