	<field name = "BODY">McGraw-Hill Inc said it has sold its
McGraw-Hill Book Co South Africa Pty Ltd subsidiary to a local
management group for an undisclosed amount of cash and halted
the sale of all products and services to South Africa.

its board in February that cited increased political and social
unrest within South Africa and the refusal of the South African
government to abolish the apartheid system.
