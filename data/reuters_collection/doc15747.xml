	<field name = "BODY">European Community trade experts will
meet in Brussels tomorrow to discuss possible EC action against
Japan over trade, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
said.
    She told Parliament the officials would examine ideas put
forward by the U.K. Last weekend. "Trade matters and trade
initiatives have to be taken by the Community," Thatcher said.
    She said the experts would focus "on more effective action
against the dumping of components (by Japan), possible
unbinding of tariffs on certain products (to allow each EC
country to set their own tariffs) ... And measures which might
be necessary to avoid diversion if the United States acts
against Japan."
