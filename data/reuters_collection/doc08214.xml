foiled an attempted coup apparently led by senior police
officers in Sierra Leone, government sources said.
    The revolt included an unsuccessful raid on a Freetown
military arsenal during which a police officer's driver was
shot dead, they said. Police sources said a senior policeman
was arrested on suspicion of leading the coup attempt.
    There were no immediate reports in the official news media.
    Police and troops patrolled the centre of the capital and
there was no sign of further trouble.
