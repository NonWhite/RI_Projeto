	<field name = "content">U.S. West said it is aggressively buying
back shares of its own stock under a resolution adopted in 1984
by its board authorizing the repurchase of up to 10 mln shars
over any three-year period.
    U.S. West has about 190 mln shares outstanding.
    The company did not specify how many shares it was
currently repurchasing.
    "The fundamentals of our company remain strong," said U.S.
West vice president and treasurer Jim Anderson. "We believe
U.S. West stock represents good value and we are in the market
aggressively buying shares of our own stock."
