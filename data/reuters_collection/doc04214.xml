	<field name = "TITLE">EC COMMISSION HAS OPEN ATTITUDE ON STEEL QUOTAS</field>
	<field name = "DATELINE">STRASBOURG, March 12 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">The EC Commission said it was
adopting an "open attitude" about whether a system of production
quotas should remain for the indefinite future on heavy steel
products which account for about 45 pct of all EC steel goods.
    In a statement, the Commission reiterated its view that the
industry needs to lose between 25 and 30 mln tonnes of capacity
by 1990. It had previously said the quota system, started in
1980, should be wound up completely by the end of next year.
    The industry has argued for the maintenance of existing
quotas, which cover almost 70 pct of all output, saying almost
all steelmakers are losing money due to the depressed market.
