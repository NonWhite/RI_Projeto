Asher Edelman said Morse Shoe Inc agreed to provide it
confidential company information and that his group would make
an offer to buy Morse only in a friendly, negotiated deal.
    The group also said in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission that its members would not, without Morse
approval, buy or offer to buy any company securities giving the
group a 10 pct or more stake in the company.
    Edelman and his group said his terms held until the earlier
of 90 days from March 3 or the date on which Morse announces a
definite agreement for its sale.
    At the same time, the Edelman group said it cut its stake
in Morse to 8.4 pct from 9.7 pct.
