	<field name = "BODY">Egypt has agreed to build two new roads
in Uganda worth a total of 295 mln dlrs, Egyptian commercial
attache Muhammud el Tahan said.
    The two countries signed an agreement under which Egyptian
companies will reconstruct the roads between Fort Portal and
Bundibugyo near the Zaire border in western Uganda and between
Kapchorwa and Swam near Mount Elgon in the east of the country,
he told reporters. Uganda would repay the loan from Egypt 70
pct in unspecified barter goods and 30 pct in hard currency.
    Egypt and Uganda are also discussing the possibility of
Egyptian help for a project to grow wheat in Uganda, he added.
