	<field name = "BODY">Cotton planting continued progressing
in the week ended April 5, but cold, wet weather in the South
hampered seedbed preparation, the Joint Agricultural Weather
Facility of the U.S. Agriculture and Commerce Departments said.
    In a summary of its Weather and Crops Bulletin, the agency
said planting increased in California as soil temperatures
improved.
    Texas planted 10 pct compared with an average of eight pct.
Arizona and Georgia planted 35 pct and two pct, respectively,
it said.
    Oklahoma farmers prepared 10 pct of their cotton seedbeds,
15 points below average, the agency said.
