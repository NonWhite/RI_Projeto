	<field name = "BODY">Residents of central Oklahoma
returned to their homes over the weekend after a week of heavy
rains and severe flooding that left two dead and caused more
than 20 mln dlrs in damage, officials said.
    Some 900 people were evacuated from their homes during the
rains and flooding last week, civil defense officials said.
    Many of the shelters set up throughout the state in areas
threatened by flooding, except those near the Washita and Red
Rivers, closed as residents returned to their damaged homes.
    Farmers who had expected a near-record wheat crop now say
this year will see one of the largest losses in decades.
    Gov. Henry Bellmon, who on Thursday declared a flooding
emergency for central Oklahoma, was expected to ask President
Reagan for federal disaster relief for the area.
    In northern Texas, officials reported several tornadoes on
Friday. A twister in Lubbock yesterday damaged six mobile homes
and two houses. No injuries were reported.
