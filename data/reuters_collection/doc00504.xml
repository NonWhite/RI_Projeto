BAC.N> West German branch said it is negotiating the sale of
Bankhaus Centrale Credit AG, a small local West German bank it
acquired in 1965, and of its West German Visa credit card
operation.
    Michael Seibel, Bank of America vice-president and regional
manager, said the negotiations were proceeding well. He
declined to give further details.
    Bank of America's West German branch lost some 32 mln marks
in 1985. The result includes profit and loss transfers from
Bankhaus Centrale Credit and the Visa organisation. The sale of
the units is part of the bank's worldwide restructuring plan.
