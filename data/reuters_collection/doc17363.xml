	<field name = "content">General Dynamics Corp was named as a
defendant in a multimillion dlr fraud suit brought by the U.S.
government in 1985 stemming from government subsidized
shipbuilding contracts, according to court documents.
    The government originally filed the suit against two of
Dynamic's officers and two officers of its subcontractor,
Frigitemp Corp. The suit, filed in federal court in New York,
seeks to reclaim funds from kickbacks, overpayments and
subsidies that were allegedly overexpended on two shipbuilding
projects. The government paid 70 mln dlrs in subsidies between
1978 and 1982, court papers said.
