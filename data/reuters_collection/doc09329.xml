	<field name = "BODY">Tseng Laboratories Inc said it
expects first quarter 1987 sales to exceed total sales for the
entire 1986 year, and said it expects earnings for the quarter
to grow at a faster rate than sales.
    Tseng posted total revenues for 1986 of 4,255,731, and net
income of 258,125, or 14 cts per share.
    Jack Tseng, president of the company, attributed the high
expectations to increased orders from major costomers, as well
as accelerated business from its growing reseller network.
    Tseng posted first quarter 1986 sales of 549,950, and net
income of 19,163, the company said.
