	<field name = "DATELINE">NEW YORK, April 7 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">Comex gold futures held pared gains at
midsession after the metal repeatedly stalled in the face of
trade selling resistance, analysts said.
    They attributed gold's modest price rise to a buoyant
silver market. Professional traders and investors again bought
silver on speculation it would soon hit seven dlrs an ounce.
    The pacesetting June gold delivery traded at 423.60 dlrs an
ounce, up one dlr but below a session high of 425.20 dlrs.
Other contracts were 80 cts to 1.50 dlrs firmer.
    Trading was thin as participants closely watched the
foreign exchange and U.S. stock markets, brokers said.
