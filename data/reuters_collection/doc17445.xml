	<field name = "DATELINE">SINGAPORE, June 1 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">Singapore Petroleum Co Pte Ltd will
revise pump prices of petrol from June 2, an official said.
    Grade 97 octane with 0.15 gm/lead will be 96.8 cents/litre
against 94 cents previously for 0.4 gm lead. Grade 92 octane
will be 90.6 cents against 87.6 previously.
    SPC's price revision follows the Ministry of Trade and
Industry's move to liberalise petrol pricing by allowing oil
companies to set their own pump prices.
    New grades of petrol with lower lead content are sold in
Singapore from today in line with the Ministry of Environment's
regulations.
