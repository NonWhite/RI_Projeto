Corp> said two exploratory oil wells in the Zama area of
Alberta tested 1,020 and 950 barrels a day, and will increase
the company's daily oil production by 30 pct.
    The company did not immediately elaborate on total
production figures.
    The wells, flowing oil from the Keg River formation, will

day to optimize reserve recovery, the company said.
    Permanent production facilities are being installed and the
wells will produce to pipeline by mid-April.
