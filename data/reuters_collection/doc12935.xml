	<field name = "DATELINE">WASHINGTON, April 3 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">The Democratic-controlled U.S. Senate
sided with President Reagan and defeated an attempt to cut U.S.
aid to Mexico as a protest it is failing to cooperate fully
with the American war against drugs.
    A day after the Senate trounced Reagan's attempt to sustain
a veto of a major highway bill, a bipartisan majority gave him
a victory by shelving on a 49 to 38 vote a measure to halve
assistance given Mexico.
    Two companion measures also were expected to be defeated,
to halve aid to Panama and the Bahamas.
    The fight was considered more symbolic than having
significant impact, since Mexico this year is receiving a
relatively small 15.7 mln dlrs in assistance. But critics said
cutting the aid would hurt U.S.-Mexico relations.
