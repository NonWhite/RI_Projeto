said.
    Sight deposits are an important measure of money market
liquidity in Switzerland.
    Foreign exchange reserves fell by 627.4 mln francs to 32.50
billion francs. The National Bank attributed this fall to the
dismantling of outstanding swap arrangements.

billion while other deposits on call at the National Bank,
mainly government funds, fell by 116.0 mln francs to 825.5 mln.
