	<field name = "DATELINE">LONDON, April 7 -</field>
	<field name = "content">Robusta futures held small gains of 12 to
five stg per tonne at midmorning in quiet trade, with second
position July traded up seven at 1,258 stg.
    Recent increased roaster demand and physical offtake of
coffee prompted light general buying, dealers said.
    However, some analysts believed prices should be weakening
due to the increase in Colombian, Brazilian and Mexican coffee
on the market after origin sales of the past week. They were
perplexed by steadiness in futures, they said.
    Trade houses rolled May positions into July and September
contracts. Volume was 969 lots including 520 crosses.
