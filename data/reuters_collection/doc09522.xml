Lyng said agriculture should share spending cuts under the
Gramm-Rudman law and that this would ultimately help exports.
    "There needs to be some reduction of some expenditures to at
least get close to the Gramm-Rudman figure," he said.
"Agriculture would not be independent from that."
    He told a Virginia Farm Bureau lunch, "I don't think anyone
believes we'll meet the 108 billion dlr target."
    Lyng said if the federal deficit came down, this would help
exports. "A failure to get the fiscal deficit under control is
having a harmful effect on agricultural exports."
    He added, however, that U.S. agricultural exports had
increased under the Farm Security Act but so far had not
recovered to what he called the successful levels of 1981.
