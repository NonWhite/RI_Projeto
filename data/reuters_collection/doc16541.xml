	<field name = "DATELINE">BAHRAIN, April 13 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">Iran said it had achieved its
objectives in heavy fighting against Iraq since launching an
offensive near the southern Iraqi city of Basra last Tuesday.
    Baghdad said on Saturday its forces had routed the Iranians
from the few footholds they initially gained. But an Iranian
field commander said on Sunday the Iranians are now entrenched
west of the Jasim River and the Fish canal, about 10 km east of
Basra.
    The unnamed commander, quoted by the Iranian news agency
IRNA, said foreign reporters could now visit Iranian
strongholds in the region.
