	<field name = "BODY">Igene Biotechnology Inc said it
terminated its license agreement with Hercules Inc HPC> for
the manufacture of Igene's natural food preservative and mold
inhibitor.
    It said the cancellation agreed to by both companies.
    Igene said its Weyco-Serv product was licensed to Hercules
in September 1985.
    Under the terms of the agreement, Igene regains all rights,
title and interest in its proprietary microorganisms, process
and product and will repay out of future products sales certain
royalties.
   
    The cancellation of the contract allows Igene to proceed
with plans to produce NaturServ, a modified version of
Weyco-Serv, the company said. The new product is expected to be
available early next year, Igene said.
    The company also said it plans to build a new multiproduct
fermentation plant to meet anticipated demand for NaturServ and
other company natural products.
    Both Weyco-Serv and NaturServ contain high concentrations
of acid salts that naturally inhibit spoilage and molding, the
company said.
