	<field name = "content">U.S. commodity markets should not
suffer any long-term ill effects from Monday's financial
turmoil, Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said.
    "I think traditionally that commodity markets have moved
separately from the equity shares, so I wouldn't think that
this would have any long-term effect," Lyng told Reuters in an
interview.
    Most commodity futures prices declined on Monday, some
sharply, largely in response to plummeting stock prices. Many
futures prices rallied on Tuesday.
