	<field name = "DATELINE">LONDON, March 26 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur
discussed the need to control public spending in talks here
today with British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, a
Treasury spokesman said.
    The spokesman said the ministers reviewed their economies,
and public spending, domestic and European Community-wide.
    He declined to comment on whether the subject of concerted
action to shore up the dollar had arisen. The U.S. Currency
dipped sharply earlier this week after a month of relative
stability after an agreement by six major industrialised
nations in Paris on February 22 to stabilise their currencies.
