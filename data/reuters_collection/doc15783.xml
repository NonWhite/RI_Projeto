	<field name = "content">Mars Stores Inc said sales for
the five weeks ended April 4 were off 22.3 pct to 8,242,525
dlrs from 10.6 mln dlrs a year earlier.
    The company said sales for the first nine weeks of its
fiscal year were off 14.5 pct to 14.1 mln dlrs from 16.5 mln
dlrs a year before.
    Results exclude the discontiued Big Value Outlet division,
it said, and are not directly comparable because Easter fell in
March last year and will fall late in April this year.
