	<field name = "BODY">Mexico has no intention of leaving
the International Coffee Organization (ICO), in the event of
Brazil withdrawing from the group, the Mexican Coffee Institute
(IMC) said.
    The IMC said in a statement the ICO is an important
instrument for ensuring producers obtain an adequate price.
Mexico currently produces around five mln 60-kilo bags of
coffee per year.
    Brazil said during a meeting of coffee producers in Rio de
Janeiro over the weekend that it would consider leaving the ICO
if its export quota was reduced by the organization.
