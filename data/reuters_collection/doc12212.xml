	<field name = "BODY">Loral Corp climbed 3-3/4 to 48-3/4 amid
rumors the company might be a takeover target of General
Electric Co GE>. However, analysts said they were skeptical.
    "Jack Welch doesn't want any more exposure to defense
markets," said one analyst who heard the rumors but doubted
their accuracy. The reference was to GE's chairman.
    The analyst, who requested anonymity, said, "I wouldn't
believe this one unless there's a deal on the table."
    Loral Corp officials were not immediately available for
comment.
