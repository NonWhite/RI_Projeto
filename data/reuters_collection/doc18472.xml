global travellers cheque industry to grow three to six pct a
year in the next five to 10 years despite growing competition
from credit cards, divisional manager K.S. Nicklin said.

increase to between 39 and 40 billion dlrs in 1987 from 37 to
38 billion in 1986 because of worldwide economic recovery.
    He said China, the Gulf states, South America and Japan
