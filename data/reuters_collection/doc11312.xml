said it has received permission to resume marketing its
Diapulse pulsed high peak power electromagnetic energy medical
device for treatment of postoperative edema and pain in
superficial soft tissues.
    The company said it had been enjoined from marketing the
product in the U.S. since 1972 due to a labeling impasse with
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
    It said the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
New York modified an injunction against sale of the product
following a motion filed jointly by the company and the FDA.
