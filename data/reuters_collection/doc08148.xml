	<field name = "BODY">Indonesia's non-oil and gas exports
fell to 5.79 billion dlrs in calendar 1986 from 5.98 billion in
1985, according to Bank Indonesia figures.
    Coffee exports rose to 753 mln dlrs from 580 mln in 1985,
but rubber shipments fell to 625 mln from 720 mln and tin to
180.6 mln from 246 mln, weekly central bank figures show.
    Indonesia hopes to boost its non-oil exports to make up for
oil revenue lost because of lower prices. But the lower value
of commodities such as timber, rubber, palm oil and tea on
world markets has prevented this, despite a 31 pct devaluation
of the rupiah against the dollar in September.
