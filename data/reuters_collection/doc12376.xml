	<field name = "content">Beryl Sprinkel, Chairman of
President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisors, denounced
protectionism as a means of addressing the U.S.s' mounting
trade imbalance and said stepped-up ecomonic growth would be a
more effective means of reducing the deficit.
    "Rather than risking the outbreak of protectionism we
should strive to reduce trade restrictions and to promote a
more open system of international trade," Sprinkel said.
    Sprinkel, in a speech delivered to the Los Angeles Chamber
of Commerce, also said the budget deficit must be reduced
through lower government spending in order to promote growth.
