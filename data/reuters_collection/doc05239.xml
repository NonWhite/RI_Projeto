	<field name = "content">Sweden's industrial production fell
1.8 pct during January compared with a fall of 0.8 pct the
month before and remains unchanged compared with January 1986,
according to figures from the Central Bureau of Statistics.
    The bureau attributed the fall to a long Christmas break
and particularly cold weather, which lowered production in the
forestry industry.
