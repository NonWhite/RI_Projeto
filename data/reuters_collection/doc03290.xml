	<field name = "content">American and Soviet arms negotiators will
resume talks on curbing medium-range nuclear missiles here
tomorrow, a U.S. Spokesman said.
    The negotiations on nuclear and space arms formally
recessed their seventh round last Friday.
    But both sides agreed that the group dealing with
Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) would continue its work,
following proposals introduced last week by both superpowers
for deep cuts in those weapons.
