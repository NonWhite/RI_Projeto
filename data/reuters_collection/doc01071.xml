they completed a second hole at their jointly owned Doyon mine
in Quebec, which showed two significant gold intersections.
    One intersection graded 0.33 ounce gold a short ton over 44
feet at depth of 1,411 feet, while the other graded 0.22 ounce
gold a ton over 23 feet at 2,064 feet, the companies said. The
