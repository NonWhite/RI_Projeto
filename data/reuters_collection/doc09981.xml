	<field name = "DATELINE">WASHINGTON, March 26 -</field>
	<field name = "content">The Senate voted to condemn the
proposed European common market tax on vegetable and fish fats
and oils and said it would result in retaliation.
    The non binding Senate resolution, a sense of Senate
sentiment, was approved on a 99 to 0 vote.
    "The administration should communciate to the European
Community the message that the United States will view the
establishment of such a tax as inconsistent with the European
Community's obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade that will result in the adoption of strong and
immediate countermeasures," the resolution stated.
