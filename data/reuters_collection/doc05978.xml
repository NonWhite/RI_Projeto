    The exchange said the trip was to explore potential trading
links between PSE and other Pacific Rim exchanges and to
discuss growth of capital markets in the Far East.

technical assistance and begin cooperative relationships with
exchanges and securities markets in the Pacific Rim," Maurice
Mann, chairman of PSE, said in a statement.
