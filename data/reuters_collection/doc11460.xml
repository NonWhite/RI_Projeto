	<field name = "DATELINE">WASHINGTON, March 31 -</field>
	<field name = "content">The United States and Japan are not
involved in a trade war, despite U.S. sanctions announced last
week against Japanese semiconductors, U.S. Trade Representative
Clayton Yeutter said.
    "In my judgement, we're not even close to a trade war,"
Yeutter told a House Agriculture Committee hearing.
    Yeutter said if Japan takes action to honor its agreement
with the U.S. on semiconductor trade, "Then the retaliatory
response will last a relatively short period."
    Yeutter said Japan must stop dumping chips in third
countries and buy more American computer chips.
