	<field name = "content">Nigeria's military government clamped a
dusk-to-dawn curfew on northern Kaduna state and ordered all
schools and colleges there closed after 11 people died in
clashes between Moslems and Christians.
    A statement said the situation in Kaduna was now under
control, after two days of disturbances caused by "undesirable
elements hiding under the cover of religion."
    The statement, signed by Rear-Admiral Augustus Aikhomu, the
regime's number two, urged the media to exercise restraint in
reporting the clashes which began last weekend in Kafanchan, a
Christian enclave in the mainly-Moslem north.
