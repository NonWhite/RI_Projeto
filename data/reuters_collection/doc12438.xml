	<field name = "BODY">Zimbabwe's Grain Marketing Board has
banned the packing of oilseeds in locally-made polypropylene
bags and will supply jute bags instead, board officials said.
    It said the quality of oilseeds such as soybeans,
groundnuts and sunflower seed packed in polypropylene bags
deteriorated after two weeks.
    Zimbabwe began producing 10 mln polypropylene grain bags
this year to replace jute bags imported mainly from Bangladesh.
