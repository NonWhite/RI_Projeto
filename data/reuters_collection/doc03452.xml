	<field name = "content">Japanese crushers are likely to buy at
least 200,000 tonnes of Brazilian soybeans this year and
another 100,000 to 200,000 if quality and shipping conditions
are good against 128,089 tonnes in 1986, trade sources said.
    A Japanese trading house recently bought about 31,000
tonnes of soybeans for April 10/May 10 shipment, they said.
    "Because Brazilian soybean prices are now some 10 cents a
bushel cheaper than U.S. Origin due to the bumper harvest, it
is highly likely that Japanese crushers will increase their
buying volume," one source said. Brazilian beans are available
to Japan for shipment from May to July.
