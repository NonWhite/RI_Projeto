	<field name = "DATELINE">LAGOS, April 24 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">Nigeria's military government retreated
in the face of hostile public opinion and restored the minimum
wage of 125 naira (about 32 dlrs) a month.
    It revoked an order made only last December which exempted
companies with fewer than 500 employees -- the vast majority --
from paying the minimum wage.
    Labour Minister Brigadier Ike Nwachukwu, announcing the
decision in Lagos today, said it was made out of respect for
public opinion and to maintain industrial harmony.
    Nwachukwu said the thinking behind the exemption was in
line with Nigeria's far-reaching structural adjustment program
and the measure was intended to promote small-scale industry
and agriculture.
