	<field name = "BODY">President Reagan's nominee as
director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Robert
Gates, withdrew his name from consideration by the Senate in
the face of a long battle for confirmation.
    His withdrawal was announced at a White House news
conference by Reagan's new Chief-of-Staff, Howard Baker, who
said the President had accepted it with great regret.
    Gates, now deputy head of the CIA, had been questioned
about CIA involvement in the Iran-contra scandal and leading
senators had warned his nomination was in trouble. Baker said
Gates would remain as deputy director of the spy agency.
