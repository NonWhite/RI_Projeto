	<field name = "BODY">President Reagan formally ended
preferential duty-free trade treatment for exports from
Nicaragua, Romania and Paraguay under the Generalized System of
Preferences (GSP).
    He took the action after determining that the three
countries are not taking steps to give their workers
internationally recognized rights.
    U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter had announced the
intended action on January 2. The United States conducts no
trade with Nicaragua and very little trade with Romania and
Paraguay.
