	<field name = "content">Top officials of leading industrial
nations arrived at the U.S. Treasury main building to begin a
meeting of the Group of Five.
    Officials seen arriving by Reuter correspondents included
West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank
President Karl Otto Poehl, French Finance Minister Edouard
Balladur and his central banker Jacques de Larosiere.
    Also seen arriving were Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa and Japan's central bank governor Satoshi Sumita and
British Chancellor of the Exchequer and central bank governor
Robin Leigh Pemberton.
    There was no immediate sign of Italian or Canadian
officials. Monetary sources have said a fully blown meeting of
the Group of Seven is expected to begin around 3 p.m. local
time (1900 gmt) and last at least until 6 p.m. (2200 gmt), when
a communique is expected to be issued.
    Italian sources said Italian acting Finance Minister
Giovanni Goria met Treasury Secretary James Baker last night.
    At those talks Baker apparently convinced Goria, who
declined to attend the February meeting of the Group of Seven
in Paris, that Italy would participate fully in any meaningful
decisions.
