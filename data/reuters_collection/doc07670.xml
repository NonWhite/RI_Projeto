	<field name = "DATELINE">ANNAPOLIS, Md., March 20 -</field>
	<field name = "content">Sonex Research Inc said its
modified 1986 British Ford Escort passed the European emissions
test, but reported the engine consumed 35 pct more fuel than
the stock engine.
    Sonex said its engine is not equipped with a catalytic
converter and does not use exhaust gas recirculation or an
emission air pump. It said the company expected to realize a
reduced fuel economy, but is working on improving fuel
consumption.
    The company said after it installs the new fuel system, it
will retest the automobile.
    In a separate announcement, the company said it received
confirmation from the European Patent Office that Sonex
successfully defended its BETA European Patent from a
competitor.
