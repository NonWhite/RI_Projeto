sell its Oklahoma-based oil and gas unit as part of its
strategy to focus on developing precious metals properties.
    The company said it bought the Wyona Water Flood Oil and
Gas unit in 1984 for 650,000 dlrs.
    Crown said the Wyona field is fully developed with 28
producing wells.
    Current oil production is 80 barrels a day, it said, adding
