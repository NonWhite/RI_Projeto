	<field name = "DATELINE">BOSTON, June 18 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">Gillette Co said Revlon Group made an
unsolicited request, asking the Gillette board to allow Revlon
to make a cash offer for all Gillette shares of at least 40.50
dlrs per share.
    Gillette said consent for the bid is required under a
standstill agreement between Revlon and Gillette before Revlon
can make any move on Gillette's stock.
    In November 1986, Revlon made an unsolicited offer for
Gillette shares, Gillette said.
    Subsequently, Revlon withdrew its offer, sold back to
Gillette the shares it owned at that time and entered into the
standstill agreement.
    The Gillette board of directors has a regularly scheduled
meeting this afternoon, and Gillette said it anticipates making
a statement after that meeting.
