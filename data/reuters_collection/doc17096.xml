	<field name = "DATELINE">COPENHAGEN, April 24 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">Sugar beet planting in Denmark is
about two weeks behind normal due to a severe winter and a wet
spring, a spokesman for the country's largest sugar beet
concern, De Danske Sukkerfabrikker A/S, said.
    The weather has improved recently but very little beet has
been drilled so far.
    "If good weather conditions continue, I think we will be
sowing next week or the following week," the spokesman said.
