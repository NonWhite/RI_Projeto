	<field name = "DATELINE">THE DALLES, Ore., March 26 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">Northwest Aluminum Co said it
will open a second pot line in mid-May, bringing the smelter
here to 80 pct of its production capacity.
    Northwest Aluminum President Brett Wilcox, who leased the
30-year-old smelter from Martin Marietta Corp., said production
would increase from around 45 tons a year at present to just
over 70 tons.
    Martin Marietta closed and mothballed the smelter in 1984.
Northwest Aluminum reopened it last December.
    Wilcox said a good aluminum market and several months of
successful operation led to the decision to expand production.
