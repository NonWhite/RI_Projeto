	<field name = "BODY">(Rhone Poulenc Pharma Inc) said it
plans to spend 29 mln dlrs over the next five years for
research and development in Canada. It said the investment
depends upon passage of a federal government bill which
proposes greater protection for holders of drug patents.
    The company said it will spend 7.9 mln dlrs to upgrade its
Montreal operations.

reasonable protection from generic drug copying of new
compounds.
