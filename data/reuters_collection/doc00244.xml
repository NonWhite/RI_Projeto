	<field name = "DATELINE">BAGHDAD, March 1 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">Iraq said its troops repelled an
overnight attack by three divisions of Iranian Revolutionary
Guards near Basra in southern Iraq.
    A military communique said the Iranians in a "perfidious"
attack rushed forward positions last night and this morning.
    A military spokesman later said the Iraqi Third Army Corps,
whose troops fought off the Iranians, had a new commander,
revealing for the first time that the previous general had been
replaced. He said Lieutenant General Dhiya'uldin Jamal, former
commander of the Fifth Army Corps, also positioned in the Basra
area, had replaced Major General Tala' Khalil al-Douri.
