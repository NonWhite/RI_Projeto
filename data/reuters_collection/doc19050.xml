net profit in the year ending March 31, 1988, is expected to be
unchanged from a year earlier.

crude oil price of 18 dlrs a barrel, a company spokesman told
Reuters. Sales in 1987/88 are estimated at 15,100 billion yen,
up 2.3 pct from a year earlier.
    The company earlier reported group net profit of 20.07
billion yen in the year ended March 31, 1987, up 8.6 pct from a
year earlier, helped by a drop in sales and administration
costs and reduced interest charges.
