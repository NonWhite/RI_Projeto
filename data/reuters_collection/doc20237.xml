having liquidity problems.
    The statement was made by Hutton Chief Financial Officer
Edward Lill. Sources at Hutton said senior management was
meeting and that a statement would be made to employees when
the meeting ended.
    Sources said they assumed the statement would pertain to
market rumors the firm's having liquidity problems and that it
is considering bankruptcy.

to file bankruptcy. Rumors that several big firms have had
problems circulated world markets. Hutton stock hit a low of 11
