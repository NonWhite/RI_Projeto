	<field name = "BODY">Computer Identics Corp said its
board elected Frank Wezniak to the new position of chief
executive officer and as director and president, succeeding
David Collins.
    Collins, also founder of the company, said he resigned
because the company has progressed beyond the entrepreneurial
stage and requires the management experience that Weznkiak
possesses.
    Wezniak has been active in several early stage venture
capital investments and serves on a number of high tech
corporation boards.

demand notes for 600,000 dlrs to one mln dlrs to an investor
