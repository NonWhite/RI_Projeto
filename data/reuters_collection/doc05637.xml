	<field name = "BODY">More than 500 people arrested during last
week's riots in northern Nigeria will face summary trial by a
judicial tribunal, President Ibrahim Babangida said.
    He said investigations showed the the violence was
carefully planned by "evil men" and those arrested would be tried
for arson, murder, rape and treason, some of which carry the
death penalty.
    Babangida said the crisis was "the civilian equivalent of an
attempted coup d'etat" against the government.
