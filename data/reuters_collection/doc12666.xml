	<field name = "BODY">McKesson Corp said it sold the
California Culinary Academy of San Francisco to an investor
group headed by the academy's president, Fred Seymour, for
undisclosed terms.
    The 400-student academy was founded nine years ago and was
acquired in 1982 by McKesson. The company said it sold it
because it no longer fits with its business direction.
