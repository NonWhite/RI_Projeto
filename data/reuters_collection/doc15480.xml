	<field name = "BODY">The Kingdom of Belgium is launching 100
mln Swiss francs of seven year notes with warrants attached to
buy gold, lead manager Credit Suisse said.
    The notes themselves have a 3-3/8 pct coupon and are priced
at par. Payment is due April 30, 1987, and final maturity April
30, 1994.
    Each 50,000 franc note carries 15 warrants. Two warrants
are required to allow the holder to buy 100 grammes of gold at
a price of 2,450 francs, during the entire life of the bond.
    The latest gold price in Zurich was 2,045/2,070 francs per
100 grammes.
