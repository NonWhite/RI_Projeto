	<field name = "DATELINE">LONDON, April 7 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">Gold bullion was fixed this morning at
419.80 dlrs an ounce, down on last night's close of
421.50/422.00, dealers said.
    The market opened little changed at 421.90/422.40 but eased
during the morning as dealers traded on the gold/silver ratio,
selling gold and buying silver.
    Business was fairly light as trading in gold was
overshadowed by interest in silver.
    Platinum was fixed this morning at 565.75 dlrs, slightly up
on last night's close of 564.50/565.50.
