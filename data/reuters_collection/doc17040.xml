	<field name = "DATELINE">TOKYO, April 24 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">The Bank of Japan intervened just after
the Tokyo market opened to support the dollar from falling
below 140.00 yen, dealers said.
    The central bank bought a moderate amount of dollars to
prevent its decline amid bearish sentiment for the U.S.
Currency, they said.
    The dollar opened at a record Tokyo low of 140.00 yen
against 140.70/80 in New York and 141.15 at the close here
yesterday. The previous Tokyo low was 140.55 yen set on April
15.
