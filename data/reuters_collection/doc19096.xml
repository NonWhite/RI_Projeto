	<field name = "BODY">China has resumed repairs of Soviet ships
after a 23 year break caused by the ideological split between
the two countries.
    The New China News Agency said an agreement to resume the
business was signed by the two sides on Wednesday in Shanghai,
where three Soviet commercial vessels were being repaired.
    The China Daily said the first two Soviet ships to be
repaired in China since 1964 left the ports of Dalian and
Xingang last month.
    Bi Yueran, managing director of China State Shipbuilding
Corp's ship repair department, told the newspaper the Soviet
Union lacked adequate repair facilities for the more than 600
ships deployed in the far east. Bi said China's yards offered
competitive prices, guaranteed quality and prompt delivery.
