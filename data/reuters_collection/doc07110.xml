	<field name = "BODY">Blockbuster Entertainment Corp said it
will sell its investment in Amtech Corp to the company

    The company said the sale is taking place because Amtech is
not compatible with Blockbuster's main line of business, will
require substaintial additional funding to develop and market
its product, and is expected to sustain operating losses for
the forseeable future.
    The company said Cook and Anderson will form a new company
with the sale called Amtech Holdings Inc.
