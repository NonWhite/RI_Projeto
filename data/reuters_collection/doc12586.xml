	<field name = "BODY">No changes have been made or are
being planned in the Agriculture Department's calculation of
price differentials between interior grain locations and the
Texas Gulf, a senior USDA official said.
    Ralph Klopfenstein, USDA deputy administrator for commodity
operations, told Reuters, "We do not anticipate any changes to
be made" in the Texas Gulf differentials used to calculate
posted county prices for corn.
    "We do not relate the Texas Gulf structure with the
Louisiana Gulf structure at all. It's a totally different
situation," he said.
    Rumors had circulated through the market this morning that
USDA had widened Texas Gulf differentials in a similar manner
to last weekend's adjustments with the Louisiana Gulf.
