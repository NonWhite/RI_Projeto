	<field name = "BODY">House Speaker Jim Wright said a
gasoline tax is one option to finding a way to reduce the
deficit, but told reporters in response to a question he will
not try to dictate a solution to the debt problem.
    Wright has made suggestions for raising taxes about 20
billion dlrs as part of a budget plan to reduce the deficit.
Tax proposals are being given consideration by members of the
House Budget Committee, but the details of any tax increase
would be made by the tax writing House ways and Means
Committee.
