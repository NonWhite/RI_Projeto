has signed a marketing agreement with Apollo Computer Inc.
    Phoenix said that the agreement allows Apollo to market
Phoenix's software under the name "Domain/PC Emulator."
    The company said that the software will be available on
Apollo's new Domain Series 4000 personal workstations and
Apollo's current generation of machines by the end of this
