	<field name = "DATELINE">NEW YORK, June 2 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">Moody's Investors Service Inc said it is
likely that large underwriting losses will persist in the
mortgage insurance industry for at least the next two years.
    In its annual report on the mortgage insurance industry,
Moody's said that in 1986 incurred losses increased by 21 pct
over the dismal record posted the year before.
    Moody's said the underwriting losses mainly reflected major
economic forces, structural complications and the risk makeup
of the industry. The rating agency said that, while mortgage
insurance industry risk remains high, slow improvement appears
likely.
