	<field name = "BODY">President Reagan said he will use the
annual economic summit of major industrialized countries to
press for economic expansion by West Germany and Japan.
    In a pre-summit speech at the White House, Reagan said that
preserving a growing world economy was the business of every
member of the world trading community.
    "It will be made clear, especially to our friends in Japan
and the Federal Republic of Germany that growth-oriented
domestic policies are needed to bloster the world trading
system on which they depend," he said.
