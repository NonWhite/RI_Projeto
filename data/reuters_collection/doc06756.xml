	<field name = "BODY">peru's short-term foreign trade credit
lines have more than doubled to 430 mln dlrs under president
alan garcia's 20-month administration.
    Central bank general manager hector neyra told reporters 
that many of the credits were for 90-day terms and could be
used several times a year.
    The trade credits stood at 210 million dollars when garcia
took office on july 28, 1985, and announced foreign debt
payments would be limited to 10 pct of export earnngs.
    Neyra told reuters that peru was current on interest
payments on short-term debt, including the trade credit lines
and on about 750 million dollars in so-called  "working capital"
credits.
    Neyra did not specify the source of the trade credit lines.
