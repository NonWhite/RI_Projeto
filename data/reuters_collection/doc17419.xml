	<field name = "BODY">President Reagan said a further
decline in the value of the dollar could be counterproductive.
    In written answers to questions put by Japan's Asahi
Shimbun newspaper, he noted Treasury Secretary James Baker had
said all seven major industrial nations were committed to
cooperating in fostering stability of exchange rates.
    "We all believe a further decline of the dollar could be
counterproductive," Reagan said.
    Reagan said the best way for the United States to reduce
its trade deficit was to export more.
    He said Japan could make a major contribution to reducing
external imbalances and sustaining world economic growth by
adopting policies to promote stronger domestic demand in the
short-run and, in the long-run, implementing structural reforms
to ease Japanese dependence on exports as a source of growth.
