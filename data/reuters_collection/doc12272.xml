	<field name = "BODY">The Democratic-controlled House
Budget Committee, over Republican protests, approved and sent
to the House a trillion dlr spending budget for 1988 that would
cut the anticipated federal deficit by about 38 billion dlrs.
    The Democratic-written budget would produce about a 133
billion dlr deficit using the nonpartisan Congressional Budget
Office economic assumptions.
    Using President Reagan's more optimistic assumptions the
deficit would be about 108 billion dlrs -- which would reach a
new budget law's goal.
