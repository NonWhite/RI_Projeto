	<field name = "BODY">Industrial production in the European
Community (EC) in January showed no growth compared with
January 1986, the EC statistics office, Eurostat, said in a
report.
    It said the EC industrial production index, base 1980,
stood at 103.9 in both months.
    EC officials said while the lack of growth may have been
due in part to the icy weather which gripped large parts of the
EC in January, it also reflects a worrying trend.
    Eurostat said for the last three months for which figures
are known, industrial output rose by only 0.9 pct compared with
the year-earlier period.
    Annual growth in the 12 months to January averaged about
1.8 pct, well below the 2.8 pct figure recorded in the 12
months ending last June, the office said.
