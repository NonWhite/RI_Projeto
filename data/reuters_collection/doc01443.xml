	<field name = "content">Shin-Etsu Chemical Co Ltd said it had
developed an ultra thermal resistance rubber which can be used
at 250 centigrade continuously without losing its properties.
    Shin-Etsu put potential demand for the product at two
tonnes a month mainly for microwave ovens and as a sealant.
    But increasing use of the product in parts attached to car
engines will raise demand and the company will boost output to
10 tonnes by March 1988 from two now, he said.
