	<field name = "DATELINE">ROTTERDAM, June 19 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">Dutch salvage firm Smit-Tak said it
may take some three weeks to lift the Swiss tug Orinoko and its
lighter Pavo which sank 10 days ago at Karlsruhe in West
Germany, blocking the Rhine river.
    Smit-Tak, which with its West German subsidiary Harms
Bergung GmbH was commissioned by the local water authorities to
raise the vessels, said its lifting fleet was in position and
divers had made the first inspection.
    Smit is still preparing its final salvage plan and said the
work would begin on Sunday.
