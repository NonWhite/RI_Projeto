	<field name = "content">Amoco Oil Co said it will continue to
sell leaded gasoline to farmers in certain portions of the
midwest as long as there is sufficient demand for the product.
    "It appears that the agricultural community will need
limited amounts of leaded gasoline for certain types of
equipment until an acceptable alternative is found," the
company said.
    Amoco previously announced it would sell all lead-free
gasoline to motorists at its service stations.
