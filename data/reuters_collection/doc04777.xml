	<field name = "DATELINE">ROTTERDAM, March 13 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">About 220 men in Rotterdam port's
grain sector stopped work this afternoon in an unofficial
protest at the slow progress of negotiations over a new work
practice agreement, a spokesman for the port and transport
union FNV said.
    Negotiations between the union and employers, which are due
to resume early next week, are currently stalemated with the
union refusing to accept sweeping changes in working hours and
practices in return for a 1.5 pct pay increase.
    The FNV spokesman said the action did not yet have official
backing, but added that next week matters might be different.
