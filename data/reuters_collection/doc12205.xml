	<field name = "content">Aid donors have promised Senegal 1.8
billion dollars in soft loan aid over the next three years, to
be split between project investment and balance of payment
requirements, the World Bank said in a statement.
    It said after a two-day meeting of the Consultative Group
for Senegal held here under its auspices the aid was to support
the second phase, running to mid-1990, of Senegal's "courageous
and far-reaching" medium and long-term adjustment programme.
