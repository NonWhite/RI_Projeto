	<field name = "BODY">Esso Malaysia Bhd, a unit of Exxon
Corp of the U.S., Reported net profit of 70 mln ringgit from
its petroleum and ammonia operations in 1986 compared with 48.7
mln in 1985. Chairman Gerald F Cox said the improved
performance was mainly due to product prices falling more
slowly than crude prices during the year.
    He added that total sales volume increased as a result of
higher offtake by affiliated companies, while inland market
sales were maintained at around the previous year's levels.
    But growth prospects in 1987 remained weak and 1986 results
are unlikely to be repeated in the current financial year.
