	<field name = "TITLE">ARAB HEAVY TERM CRUDE SUPPLIES TO JAPAN UP IN JULY</field>
	<field name = "DATELINE">TOKYO, June 18 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">Aramco Corp> has accepted Japanese
nominations to lift a higher proportion of Arab Heavy crude oil
under term contracts in July, oil industry sources said.
    Japanese companies requested a ratio of 80 pct Arab Heavy
to 20 pct Arab Light under a term contract agreement with
Aramco for 100,000 barrels per day, the sources said. The
contractual ratio is 30 pct heavy crude to 70 pct light.
    Japanese demand for heavy crude oil has increased
substantially since the All Japan Seaman's Union ceased sailing
into the northern Mideast gulf last month, causing problems
with liftings of heavy Kuwait and Khafji crudes.
