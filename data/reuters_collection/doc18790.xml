	<field name = "BODY">France's leading farmer's union, the
FNSEA, said it is worried that negotiations on the 1987/88 farm
price package will now be tackled by European Community leaders
who do not know the agricultural situation.
    The leaders have no specialised knowledge of the farm
dossier and have the tendency to sign compromises which are "too
broad," union leader Raymond Lacombe said. But he added French
Farm Minister Francois Guillaume had reason to reject a
compromise which would have been negative for the farm sector.
    EC ministers ended talks this morning having failed to get
any agreement on agricultural prices for the 1987/88 farm year,
which started on April 1 for certain products.
    Lacombe said the French government should guarantee
farmers' incomes until an agreement is reached.
