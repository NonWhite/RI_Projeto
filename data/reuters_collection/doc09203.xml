	<field name = "BODY">Ciba-Geigy AG CIGZ.Z> said it would
establish a joint venture with Phillips Petroleum Co. In Europe
to manufacture a high performance engineering thermoplastic.
    Initially, the Swiss chemicals firm will manufacture
polyphenylene sulfide compounds using resins from Phillips.
    The two firms will later set up a joint venture to produce
the polyphenylene resins and compounds, which will be marketed
independently under their respective trademarks. A Ciba-Geigy
