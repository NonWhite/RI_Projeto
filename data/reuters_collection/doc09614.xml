	<field name = "BODY">The National Association of Realtors
said sales of previously owned homes rose six pct during
February from January levels to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 3.69 mln units.
    The realtors' group said the sales rise was apparent across
the country and reflected lower mortgage interest rates as well
as more housing demand.
    Actual resales of homes during February totaled 241,000, up
11.6 pct from the January total of 216,000, the association
said.
