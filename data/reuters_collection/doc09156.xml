CAPH.HKG> to an increase in seat allocations on the busy
Manila-Hong Kong route.
    A spokesman told Reuters a memorandum of understanding
would be signed later this week between the British and
Philippine governments to allow the current total of 32 flights
a week to be increased. "There are no immediate plans for more

    PAL said an agreement reached with British Airways would
allow each carrier to keep three London-Manila flights weekly.
