	<field name = "DATELINE">FRANKFURT, April 21 -</field>
	<field name = "content">The Bundesbank intervened in the open
market to buy dollars against yen, dealers said.
    They were responding to enquiries immediately after news
the Swiss National Bank said it joined concerted intervention
to sell yen for dollars.
    The Bundesbank had no immediate comment on the reports.
    But dealers said the German central bank came into the
market just after 1300 GMT when the dollar was trading around
141.90 yen to buy small amounts of the U.S. Currency. Dollar
trading had been very quiet for most of the European session.
