	<field name = "BODY">Industrial countries do not agree on
ways to provide debt relief for the world's poorest nations, a
senior U.S. Treasury official said.
    A senior U.S. Treasury official said, "There has not been a
consensus reached yet," when asked about reports the Paris club
of western creditors had agreed to long-term stretch outs of
African debt at concessional interest rates.
    The official, briefing reporters on this week's semiannual
IMF meetings, said the issue would be discussed this week and
the U.S. had an open mind on the proposal but it did object to
concessional interest rate relief.
