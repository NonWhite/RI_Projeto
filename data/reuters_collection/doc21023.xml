	<field name = "DATELINE">NEW YORK, Oct 19 -</field>
	<field name = "content">First Boston Inc said it is conducting a
strategic review of its operations as part of a general policy
to periodically evaluate its business plans.
    The company said it is too early to predict the outcome of
the review, although it does not expect radical changes in its
organization.
    Salomon Inc SB> last week completed a strategic review
that resulted in substantial layoffs.
    Other brokerage firms are either engaged in reviews or have
made major personnel cutbacks.
