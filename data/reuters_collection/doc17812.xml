	<field name = "DATELINE">NEW YORK, June 1 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">Total Petroleum NA TPN> shut down
several small crude oil pipelines operating near the
Texas/Oklahoma border last Friday as a precaution against
damage from local flooding, according to Gary Zollinger,
manager of operations.
    Total shut a 12-inch line that runs across the Ouachita
River from Wynnewood to Ardmore with a capacity of 62,000 bpd
as well as several smaller pipelines a few inches wide with
capacities of several thousand bpd or less, Zollinger said.
    The Basin Pipeline, a major pipeline running 300,000 bpd,
run by a consortium of other oil companies, was closed today.
    One other small pipeline that Total also closed has a
capacity of 3,000 to 4,000 bpd and crosses the Red River in
Fargo, Texas, Zollinger said.
    He said the closed pipelines run under river water and
could be damaged as the flooded rivers erode the river banks
and expose the piping.
    Zollinger said Total is waiting for the river waters to
recede before they reactivate the pipelines.
