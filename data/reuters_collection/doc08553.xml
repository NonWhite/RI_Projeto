Daniel Amstutz said it is possible to reach a global agreement
to scale-back agricultural supports in calendar 1988.
    Speaking to a Senate Agriculture Appropriations committee
hearing, Amstutz said "I think we can reach agreement in
calendar 1988."
    Amstutz said the U.S. places a high priority on the Uruguay
round of global trade talks.
    His comments followed a statement by Secretary of State
George Shultz last week urging agriculture be the highest
priority item during the upcoming summit of western heads of
state in Venice, Italy.
