	<field name = "TITLE">SWEDISH DRUG FIRM ASTRA RISE ON AIDS HOPES</field>
	<field name = "DATELINE">STOCKHOLM, April 9 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">Swedish drug firm AB Astra ASTS.ST>
shares rose 48 crowns to 690 in the first two hours of trading
on the Stockholm Bourse, amid hopes its research into
anti-viral drugs may have promising results in the treatment of
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).
    Stockbrokers said the shares, which climbed amid heavy
institutional buying, also rose in reaction to an optimistic
assessment of future products in the firm's annual report which
was released this week.
    Brokers Enskilda Fondkommission said in a report this month
that Astra was a world leader in anti-viral drugs.
    Although Enskilda said Astra had not made any breakthrough
in developing a specific drug to treat the Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome it noted that investors were only now
discovering that the firm's approach in the area was promising.
    "It is clear that Astra has a tradition in anti-viral
research which should prove valuable in fighting this disease,"
the report by Enskilda, the investment banking unit of
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken SEBS.ST>, said.
    Company officials could not be reached for comment on the
causes of today's share rise.
