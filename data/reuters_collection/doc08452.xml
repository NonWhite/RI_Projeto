	<field name = "TITLE">FRENCH ECONOMIC COUNCIL PESSIMISTIC ON 1987 GROWTH</field>
	<field name = "DATELINE">PARIS, March 23 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">France's Economic and Social Council
(CES), an advisory body comprising industrialists, trade
unionists and representatives of other sectors of the French
economy, said the country's annual growth may not reach two pct
in 1987.
    French gross domestic product risks not reaching the two
pct growth registered last year, the Council said in a report
on first quarter 1987 economic activity without giving any
specific forecasts. Finance Minister Edouard Balladur was
quoted today as saying that French 1987 growth will probably be
about two pct.
    Balladur said in an interview with the financial daily Les
Echos that the country's economic growth will probably be about
the same as last year due to a less favourable international
environment.
    CES President Philippe Neeser said one of the major fears
for the French economy this year was a resurge in inflation.
    Disinflation was an absolute priority, Neeser told
journalists, adding that a failure to do this would be
extremely serious as if would be very difficult to reverse for
many years.
