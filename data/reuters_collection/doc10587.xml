	<field name = "BODY">The United States said it was doing
what it could to ease tension in the Aegean as Greek and
Turkish warships headed for a possible clash over oil drilling
rights on the sea's continental shelf.
    State Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporters,
"We have urged both sides to exercise restraint and avoid any
actions which might exacerbate the situation."
    "In the light of the most recent developments, we are
consulting with the parties and with other interested allies on
means to reduce tensions," he added.
    Redman declined to elaborate on what Washington was doing,
but he said an emergency meeting of NATO ambassadors in
Brussels on the subject was only one path it was pursuing.
    He also refused to say which side was to blame for the
renewed confrontation, saying Washington was still trying to
ascertain all the facts, as Prime minister Andreas Papanderou
said Greece was prepared to tackle any aggressor.
    "The crucial point here is that these are two friends and
allies. We don't want to see tension rise and we are doing what
we can to see if we can help here," Redman said.
