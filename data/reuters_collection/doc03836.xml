	<field name = "TITLE">FPL GROUP FPL> NUCLEAR REACTOR SHUT DOWN</field>
	<field name = "DATELINE">Miami, March 11 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">A pressure leak in a containment building
hatch at FPL Group Inc's Turkey Point nuclear plant has forced
a brief reactor shutdown, a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)
spokesman said.
    Ken Clark, the NRC's representative in Atlanta, said no
radioactivity escaped during the incident last night, which he
described as "a relatively minor problem that poses no safety
hazard."
    Clark said repairs were underway and Turkey Point Unit 4,
one of two nuclear reactors at the site south of Miami, was
expected to be reactivated later today.
