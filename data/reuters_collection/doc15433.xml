	<field name = "DATELINE">GABORONE, April 9 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">Three people were killed and two others
injured when a huge explosion, believed to be a bomb, went off
in a suburb of Botswana's capital Gaborone.
    Witnesses told Reuters the blast, near the headquarters of
the Botswana Defence Force, occurred at about 2 A.M. (1200 GMT)
and flattened several houses.
    Minutes after the explosion Botswana soldiers sealed off
the scene, which is near where South African troops last May
launched a military attack against alleged guerrilla targets.
