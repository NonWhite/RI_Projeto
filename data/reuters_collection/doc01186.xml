the subordinated debt of Guarantee Savings and Loan
Association, the principle unit of Guarantee Financial Corp, on
creditwatch with positive implications.
    About 57 mln dlrs of debt is affected.
    S/P said the move follows Gurantee's definitive agreement
to be acquired by Glendale Federal Savings and Loan, the fifth
largest S and L in the U.S.
    The combination with Glendale should enhance the
creditworthiness of Guarantee's debt, S/P said.
    Gurantee's subordinated debt is currently rated B.
