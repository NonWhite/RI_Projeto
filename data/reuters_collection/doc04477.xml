	<field name = "BODY">The U.S. Agriculture Department said
private U.S. exporters reported purchases from foreign sellers
of 120,000 tonnes of wheat for delivery to unknown
destinations.
    The wheat, consisting of 60,000 tonnes of hard red winter
and 60,000 tones of soft red winter, is for delivery during the
1987/88 season, which begins June 1.
    A purchase from a foreign seller is a transaction in which
a U.S. exporter contracts to buy U.S.-produced commodities from
a foreign firm, the department said.
