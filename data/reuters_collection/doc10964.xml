said it filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission a rate
increase of 2.9 pct in Rocky Mountain territory,
    It said the increase would offset labor and other cost
increases and not make a contribution to operating margins.
    The company said it took the independent action of filing
for the rate increase following suspension by the commission of
a general rate increase published by the Rocky Mountain Motor
Tariff Bureau. It noted that at the same time the commission
allowed similar increases published by the other regional rate
bureaus.
