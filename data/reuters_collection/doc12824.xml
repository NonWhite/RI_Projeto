	<field name = "BODY">After years of refusal, Moscow has agreed
to discuss the problems of Afghanistan and Kampuchea in its
talks with Peking on normalising relations, Chinese
Vice-Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said.
   He told a news conference: "Recently the Soviet Union
expressed agreement to discuss this question."
    China has long referred to three obstacles to better
relations -- Soviet troops in Afghanistan, Moscow's support for
Vietnamese troops in Kampuchea and Soviet troop concentrations
along the Chinese border.
