	<field name = "content">Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige
said he may recommend that the United States retaliate against
Japan if the Japanese do not permit U.S. construction firms to
participate in building the eight billion dlr Kansai airport.
    But he said he had a personal commitment from Japanese
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone that U.S. firms would have a
chance at the work.
    "I think he will honor that commitment," Baldrige told the
Senate Appropriations subcommittee on commerce affairs."
    He said one form of retaliation could be to curb Japanese
firms' two billion dlr construction work in the United States.
