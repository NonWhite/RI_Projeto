herbicide production plant in the recently-created Dunkirk
enterprise zone, an official for the Dunkirk port authority
said.
    He told Reuters the announcement was made by Industry
Minister Alain Madelin during a visit to the zone today. The
plans involve investment of around 70 mln francs.

La Ciotat and La Seyne, provide for exemption from corporate
taxes for 10 years and other incentives.
