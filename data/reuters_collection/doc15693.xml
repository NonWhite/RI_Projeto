Balladur said that the financial community is closer to
arriving at a system of target zones for currencies despite the
fact that little is being said about them.
    Speaking with reporters at the semiannual meetings of the
International Monetary Fund, Balladur said, "We are not very far
from the notion of target zones, even if we don't say so."
    He told reporters that "our ideas are progressing," adding
that the finance ministers have been talking about more
cooperation on economic policies and on levels around which
currencies should stabilize.
