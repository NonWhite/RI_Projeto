ALNT.O> said it introduced a parallel vector minisupercomputer
priced at less than 100,000 dlrs.
    The company said the new FX/4 makes multi-user
supercomputing affordable for the first time to workgroups in
industrial and commercial markets.
    The company said it also introduced high-performance
compiler and algorithm products for the FX/Series systems.
   
    Alliant said it achieved the low price for the FX/4 through
a combination of new packaging technology and cost decreases
due to semiconductor price improvements and manufacturing
efficiencies.
    The company also released the FX/C compiler, which it said
can double the performance of C programs.
    The company said its newly released algorithm products, the
FX/Linpack and FX/Eispack libraries, are collections of
mathematical subroutines that programmers can call from all
Alliant languages.
