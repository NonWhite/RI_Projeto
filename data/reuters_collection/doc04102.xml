	<field name = "DATELINE">NEW DELHI, March 12 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">India's raw cotton export quota has
been raised by 190,000 170-kg bales to 600,000 bales in 1986/87
ending August, still well below the 1985/86 quota of 1.35 mln
bales, Minister of State for Textiles R.N. Mirdha said.
    State and private agencies contracted to export 1.34 mln
bales in 1985/86, he told journalists. But only 433,000 bales
were shipped that year, with the rest to be delivered in
1986/87. About 758,000 bales from 1985/86 contracts were
shipped up to February 2 in 1986/87.
     The government will export 600,000 bales of long and
extra- long staple cotton in the three years from 1986/87, he
said.
