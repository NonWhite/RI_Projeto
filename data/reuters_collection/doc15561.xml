	<field name = "content">West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg said he was not surprised by the overnight decline
of the dollar in foreign exchange markets.
    Speaking briefly with reporters before entering a meeting
of the International Monetary Fund he said, "These minor
movements don't really affect us."
    The dollar declined in the initial reaction to a statement
by the Group of Seven industrial countries reaffirming their
Paris agreement in February to maintain their currencies around
current levels.
