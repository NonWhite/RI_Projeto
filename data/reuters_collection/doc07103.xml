	<field name = "BODY">Zimbabwe's projected coffee output of
13,000 tonnes for 1987/88 could be reduced by drought, growers
said.
    The main coffee growing areas in eastern Zimbabwe have
received little rain since April 1986 and the Coffee Growers'
Association has begun a survey to assess the effects of the
drought, a spokesman said.
    Zimbabwe exported 11,000 tonnes of coffee in 1986, mainly
to West Germany, Britain, Japan, the Netherlands, Switzerland
and the United States.
