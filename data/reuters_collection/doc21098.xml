compulsory winding up of James Tennant Commodities Ltd on
grounds of public interest and that details would be heard in

James Tennant was relatively small and that its activities had
concentrated on allowing investors to participate in pooled
trading schemes in commodity futures.
    No application had been made for the appointment of a
provisional liquidator in the case, he added.
