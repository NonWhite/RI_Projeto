(CCC) has transferred 12.0 mln dlrs in credit guarantees
previously earmarked for sales of U.S. hatching eggs and 7.0
mln dlrs in guarantees for breeder livestock to increase
coverage on sales of U.S. protein concentrates to Iraq, the
U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    The action was taken at the request of Iraq's State Trade
Organization for Grains and Foodstuffs and reduces the line for
hatching eggs to zero and the line for breeder livestock from
15.0 mln dlrs to 8.0 mln dlrs, the department said.
    The guarantee line for sales of protein concentrates has
been increased from 25.0 mln dlrs to 44.0 mln dlrs, it said.
