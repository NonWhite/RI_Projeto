said it terminated its service agreement with chairman and
chief executive Walter Steel on March 24, and appointed Donald
Michelin as acting chief executive.
    "The performance of the company since Mr. Steel's
appointment in June, 1985 has not fulfilled either Mr. Steel's

    Michelin is an Alexis Nihon officer and director.
