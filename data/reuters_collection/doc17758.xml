Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen said his proposal for
a tax of up to 330 European Currency Units per tonne on oils
and fats was likely to go up for discussion at next week's
summit meeting of EC leaders.
    EC farm ministers have been unable to agree the tax, one of
the main items proposed by Andriessen for the 1987-88 farm
price package.
    The tax, which would apply on both domestically-produced
and imported oils and fats, has been fiercely opposed by the
United States and developing countries' vegetable and marine
oil producers.
