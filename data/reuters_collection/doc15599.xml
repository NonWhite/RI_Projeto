and Exchange Commission it has reduced its stake in GenCorp Inc
to 8.6 pct, from 9.8 pct, by selling 250,000 shares at a price
equal to 118.5 dlrs per share.
    General Partners, which includes GC Holdings Inc and
General Acquisitions Inc, said yesterday it was dropping its
100-dlr-a-share hostile takeover bid for GenCorp because of
GenCorp's move to buy back its shares for up to 130 dlrs each.
