	<field name = "content">Continental Materials Corp said its
directors decided not to give further consideration to
"business combination" proposed by a stockholder group that
holds 5.2 pct of Continental Materials stock.
    Continental Materials said the offer had been received from
Continental Associates, a group of St. Louis businessmen.    
According to Continental Materials, the group said May 11 it
might boost its stake in Continental Materials. But the group
also said in a letter last week to the company that the group
had no financing. The board "did not consider it an official
offer," a Continental Materials spokeswoman said.
