chairman John Shad said the SEC's investigations of
insider-trading on Wall Street will broaden to include other
types of securities law violations.
    Shad, appearing on Cable News Network's Moneyline program,
said the SEC staff will "go down every avenue" in which it
finds violations of securities laws.
    He said the SEC staff will investigate "many more ancillary
areas." These, he said, include stock "parking" to avoid
required SEC filings on stock holdings of more than five pct
and failures by brokerage firms to meet net capital
requirements.
