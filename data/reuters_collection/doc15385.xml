	<field name = "DATELINE">MOSCOW, April 9 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">The Soviet trade deficit with the West
almost quadrupled last year, reaching 2.72 billion roubles
compared with 713 mln in 1985, official figures showed.
    Statistics published by the monthly journal Foreign Trade
showed Soviet trade turnover for 1986 fell to 130.9 billion
roubles from 142.1 billion the previous year, a drop of 7.8
pct.
    Moscow's trade surplus with East Bloc countries continued
to grow in 1986.
    Western analysts attributed the deficit rise with the West
to the world oil price slump, which hit Moscow's main export
and cut hard currency earnings needed for purchases in the
West.
