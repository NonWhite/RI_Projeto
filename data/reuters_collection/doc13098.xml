announced Colombia has been made eligible for sales of up to
15,000 tonnes of barley malt under the department's export
enhancement program, EEP.

barley malt would be made to buyers in Colombia at competitive
world prices, USDA said.
    The export sales would be subsidized with commodities from
the inventory of the Commodity Credit Corp and enable U.S.
