Angell said the Reagan appointed majority on the board was not
at odds with Chairman Paul Volcker on whether interest rates
should rise to support the dollar.
    "I would anticipate very little difference between the
chairman's position on price-level stability - and on the view
of the dollar in foreign exchange markets - and my own," Angell
said in an interview with the New York Times.
    "And I would also see very little difference in (Governor)
Manley Johnson's position and my own," he added.
    The newspaper said Angell was speaking in response to
inquiries concerning a report by syndicated columnists Rowland
Evans and Robert Novak that Volcker was ready to raise rates to
defend the dollar but that he was being thwarted by the four
Reagan appointed members on the board.
    Angell told the newspaper that there was no evidence of
disagreement on the board and that "anyone who should suggest"
there is one "might be reaching pretty far."
