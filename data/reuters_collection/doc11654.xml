	<field name = "BODY">The Commodity Credit Corporation
(CCC) has switched 10 mln dlrs in credit guarantees to Mexico
to cover purchases of U.S. wheat, the U.S. Agriculture
Department said.
    The credit guarantees were previously earmarked for sales
of U.S. dry edible beans and rice, it said.
    The action reduces the guarantee lines previously
authorized of dry edible beans to by five mln dlrs to 45 mln
dlrs and for rice from five mln to zero and increases coverage
for wheat sales from five mln to 15 mln dlrs.
