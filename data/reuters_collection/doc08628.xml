	<field name = "DATELINE">LONDON, March 24 -</field>
	<field name = "content">The Bank of England said it forecast a
shortage of around 300 mln stg in the money market today.
    Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing
in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain
some 338 mln stg while bankers' balances below target will take
out around 25 mln stg.
    Partly offsetting these outflows, a fall in note
circulation and exchequer transactions will add some 45 mln stg
and 25 mln stg to the system respectively.
