	<field name = "DATELINE">CHICAGO, March 12 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">The St Lawrence Seaway and the Welland
Canal linking Lakes Erie and Ontario were expected to open as
scheduled on March 31 and April 1, respectively, a St Lawrence
Seaway official said.
    The entire Seaway is already free of ice due to the mild
Winter and could be open for navigation today, "but there
doesn't seem to be enough demand from shipping companies to
warrant an early opening," the Canadian official said.
    Repairs are continuing at a stepped up pace on the Welland
Canal and should be completed by the April 1 start-up date, she
added.
