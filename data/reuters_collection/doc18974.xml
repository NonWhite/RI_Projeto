	<field name = "DATELINE">Calgary, Alberta, June 18 -</field>
	<field name = "content">Nova Corp is considering a
takeover bid for Dome Petroleum Ltd, either alone or as part of
a consortium, Nova chairman Bob Blair said.
    "We are thinking about making an offer to Dome or Amoco
(Canada Petroleum Co Ltd) or the creditors," Blair told
reporters before the annual meeting. Amoco Canada is a unit of
Amoco Corp AN>, which has made a 5.2 billion-dlr acquisition
offer for Dome.
    "There is ongoing, serious thought applied to Dome in Nova
and in Husky, but no decision of substance as to future action
has been taken in either company," Blair said. Nova owns 43 pct
of Husky Oil Ltd HYO.TO>.
    Blair also said that Nova has made no decision as to
whether it would want to be lead partner in a joint purchase of
Dome.
    He added that some of the discussions with other parties
about Dome included TransCanada PipeLines Ltd TRP>, but
refused to name the other participants.
