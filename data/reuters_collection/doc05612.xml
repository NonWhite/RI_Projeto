	<field name = "DATELINE">NEW YORK, March 16 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
raised to Aa-2 from Aa-3 the long-term deposit obligations of
Citizens Fidelity Bank and Trust Co because its parent,
Citizens Fidelity Corp, has merged into PNC Financial Corp.
    Moody's said the merger should strengthen the bank's
earnings potential through the acquired access to PNC's product
lines. It should also result in significantly more financial
flexibility to Citizens Fidelity, Moody's said.
    The bank's Prime-1 rating for short-term deposits was not
affected.
