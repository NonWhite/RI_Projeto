that Glenmede plans to sell a portion of its charitable
holdings of Sun common stock, of which it holds 28 pct of the
outstanding shares.
    They said the sales, to be made in the market subject to
prevailing market conditions, will not exceed 2.5 pct of Sun's
107.7 mln outstanding common shares.

stock buyback program that began in 1980.
