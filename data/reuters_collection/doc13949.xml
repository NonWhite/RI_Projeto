Volcker said international policymakers should make improving
the stability of exchange rates a major priority.
    In testimony before a Senate Banking subcommittee, Volcker
said he does not have any specific proposals for improving
exchange rate stability, but thought it was worthy goal.
    "I do think we ought to be thinking about and working toward
greater exchange rate stability," Volcker said. "I think that the
objective of greater exchange rate stability ought to loom
larger among our various policy priorities."
