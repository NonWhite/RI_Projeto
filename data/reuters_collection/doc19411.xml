Federal Bank of Florida said they filed a suit against the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board and the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp.
    The companies said the suit asks a Jacksonville, Fla.,
federal district court to enjoin the enforcement of an
interpretive rule adopted by the FHLBB last year which seeks to
give it jurisdiction over Barnett's proposed acquisition of
Home.
    The suit says this rule is arbitrary and capricious.
