	<field name = "DATELINE">SAN FRANCISCO, April 1 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">A U.S. Appeals court last night
blocked the 860 mln dlr merger of Delta Airlines Inc DAL.N>
and Western Airlines> just hours before it was to go into
effect because of a dispute over union representation.
    The ruling came in a lawsuit in which the Air Transport
Employees union said Western's management should fulfil a
promise to honour union contracts if a merger took place.
    The airlines argued that Western's promise could not be
enforced in a takeover by a larger company. Airlines officials
could not be reached for comment on the ruling, which halts the
merger until arbitration on the dispute is completed.
