	<field name = "DATELINE">GENEVA, March 23 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">Producers and consumers representing
most of world trade in natural rubber adopted a new
International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) aimed at
stabilizing world prices over the next five years.
    Negotiations for a new INRA, to succeed the present one
which runs out next October, began nearly two years ago.
    Agreement on the new five-year pact, which uses a buffer
stock to keep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as
rates rise or fall, was reached at a two-week session here
under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade
and Development (UNCTAD).
