	<field name = "TITLE">HIGHWAY BILL VETO WILL BE UPHELD, DOLE SAYS</field>
	<field name = "DATELINE">WASHINGTON, March 23 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole
said he believed the Senate would vote to sustain a
presidential veto of an 88 billion dlr highway and mass transit
bill.
    "I think the veto will be sustained," he told reporters after
he and his wife, Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole, had
met with President Reagan at the White House.
    Elizabeth Dole said, "We're going to be working on that
(sustaining a veto) and...I'm optimistic that we will sustain
it."
    But she conceded, "It will be tough."
    Reagan has said he will veto the five-year measure because
of objections to so-called highway demonstration projects and
transportation programs that put the bill about 10 billion dlr
over his budget request.
    "He needs to demonstrate that he's in charge and that he's
effective and he can't let these big things slip through,
saying 'I don't want a confrontation'," Sen. Dole said.
