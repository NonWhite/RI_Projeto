	<field name = "BODY">Standard and Poor's Corp said it
raised to A-1 from A-2 American Security Corp's commercial
paper.
    S and P also upgraded, to A and A-1 from BBB-plus and A-2
respectively, the certificates of deposit of American
Security's lead bank, American Security Bank N.A.
    The rating agency said the actions reflected the firm's
merger with what it termed a stronger Maryland National Corp,
as well as American's improving performance. S and P said the
merger would allow American Security to diversify its wholesale
funding base.
