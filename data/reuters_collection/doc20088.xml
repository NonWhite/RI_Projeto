	<field name = "content">West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg said he could not rule out the possibility of
central bank intervention to support currencies.
    Asked at a news conference whether central banks were
prepared to intervene to defend currencies, he said "We cannot
rule out the use of any instrument which leads to foreign
currency stability."
    However, he added that in the end, it was market forces
which prevailed.
