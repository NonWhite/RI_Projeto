	<field name = "DATELINE">LONDON, March 25 -</field>
	<field name = "content">Tricentrol Plc TCT.L> said it will
concentrate most of its efforts this year on its proven oil and
gas reserves in order to maximise benefits to shareholders in
the mid to long-term.
    It said in a statement "We are confident that substantial
development funds will be available to Tricentrol and that we
will be able to minimise further disposal of our interests."
    Tricentrol wrote off 57.5 mln stg on the reorganisation of
its North American operations last year, when oil prices
plunged. The group incurred a 1986 net loss of 3.7 mln stg
against a 25.4 mln profit the previous year.
