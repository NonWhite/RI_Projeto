		<field name = "AUTHOR">By Yoshiko Mori</field>
		<field name = "content">If the dollar goes the way of Wall Street,
Japanese will finally move out of dollar investments in a
serious way, Japan investment managers say.
    The Japanese, the dominant foreign investors in U.S. Dollar
securities, have already sold U.S. Equities.
    But "if the dollar falls steeply, which did not happen
yesterday, Japanese investors will definitely try to withdraw
significant funds from U.S. Shares," said Akira Kawakami, deputy
manager of Nomura Investment Trust and Management Co Ltd's
international investment department.
    An unstable, lower dollar would also affect Japanese
investment in U.S. Bonds. "Japan-U.S. Interest rate
differentials, which currently look wide enough, mean nothing
in the absence of dollar stability," said Kawakami.
    U.S. Bonds could benefit due to a gloomy economic picture
following the estimated huge losses in stocks by major U.S.
Institutional and individual investors, he said. The effect
should be to rule out any U.S. Interest rate rise.
    But most Japanese investors in U.S. Bonds are still wiating
to see if the dollar really is stable, he said. The dollar was
holding firm at above 142 yen on Tuesday morning.
    "Although Japanese investors sold huge amounts of stocks in
New York yesterday, most are still looking for chances to
lighten their U.S. Stock inventories," Hiromitsu Sunada, manager
of Meiji Mutual Life Insurance Co's international investment
department said.
    Their sales helped send Wall Street stocks down 508 points
to 1,738, the market's biggest percentage drop since 1914.
    "Investment in U.S. Stocks and bonds is difficult,
considering the dangers," said Katsuhiko Okiyama, deputy general
manager and chief adviser of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's fixed
income securities marketing group.
    Japanese investment at home could start to pick up once
markets have stopped reacting to Wall Street, the managers
said. The Tokyo yen bond market is likely to stabilise in one
or two weeks, which is what investors have been waiting for.
The bottom for yen bonds should be around a 6.3 pct yield for
the 5.1 pct 89th bond, they said.
    "The basic background which has supported the stocks and
bonds markets has not changed," said Norio Okutsu, assistant
general manager of Nikko Securities' bond department. "But new
outflows of funds to the U.S. Will be decreasing."  However,
this was already evident three months ago, he said.

		<field name = "content">The outlook for Mexico's economy and
stockmarket remains optimistic despite the market's worst-ever
fall of 52,671.56 points on Monday, the president of the
Mexican stock exchange, Manuel Somoza, said.
    He said the 16.51 pct drop in the exchange's index
reflected a "totally emotional" reaction to Monday's fall on the
New York stock exchange and was not a reflection of a new
crisis for the Mexican economy or the stockmarket."
    He was speaking at a news conference here on Monday.
    "We think that after the psycological effect the market will
tend to stabilize itself," Somoza said.
    Somoza said he based his optimism on the relatively bright
outlook of the Mexican economy due to increased income from oil
and non-petroleum exports, record high foreign reserves and
government efforts to promote a modernization of the industrial
sector.
    "The U.S. Economy is not the same as the Mexican," he said.
He did not say when he thought the market would stabilize.
    He said traders had originally expected the market to level
out on Monday after last week's profit taking pulled the index
down 44,207 points. 
    News of the "enormous problems" in New York, which reached
Mexico City before the local market opened, caused a flurry of
selling on the Mexican exchange, Somoza said.
    The stockmarket had risen 629 pct over the year by the end
of September.
    Somoza said Monday's light volume of 15.3 mln shares
compared to an average of 53 mln was an indication the day's
drop was not a sign of a major collapse.
    He also denied rumours that the day's loss was the result
of government and brokerage house manipulation.

		<field name = "AUTHOR">By Jeremy Clift</field>
		<field name = "content">Asian cocoa producers are expanding
output despite depressed world prices and they dismiss
suggestions in the London market that their cocoa is inferior.
    "Leading cocoa producers are trying to protect their market
from our product," said a spokesman for Indonesia's directorate
general of plantations. "We're happy about our long-term future."
    Malaysian growers said they would try to expand sales in
Asia and the United States if Malaysian cocoa was not suitable
for European tastes.
    They were responding to comments by London traders that
large tonnages of unwanted cocoa beans from Malaysia, Indonesia
and Papua New Guinea (PNG) were helping to depress cocoa
prices.
    London traders said the Asian cocoa was considered
unsuitable for western palates because of an acrid odour and a
high level of free fatty acids.
    Ng Siew Kee, the chairman of Malaysia's Cocoa Growers'
Council, said Malaysia should expand its sales to Asia and the
United States if it did not produce a type suitable for Western
Europe.
    A spokesman for the PNG Cocoa Industry Board said the
London market was mistaken if it linked PNG cocoa with
high-acid Malaysian and Indonesian beans.
    "When the market is declining, buyers seize on anything to
talk down prices," the spokesman said.
    He said that PNG could sell whatever cocoa it produces.
    PNG exported 33,000 tonnes of cocoa in the 1986/87 cocoa
year ending September 30, of which nearly 50 pct was exported
to West Germany, 16 pct to the U.S. And the rest to the
Netherlands and Britain.
    The Indonesia spokesman, an Agriculture Ministry official
who wished not to be identified, said Indonesia had no problem
with quality and would continue to expand sales. He described
criticism of the quality of Indonesian beans as "trade politics"
and said Jakarta's traditional links with Dutch buyers meant it
did not have any difficulty with exports.
    Indonesia and Malaysia, Asia's two biggest commodity
producers, are expanding cocoa output and are both outside the
International Cocoa Organization (ICCO).
    Officials have said Malaysian production is expected to
total 150,000 to 155,000 tonnes in calendar 1987.
    This is up from 131,000 tonnes in 1986, partly because of
the end of a three-year drought in Sabah, the country's largest
cocoa growing area.
    Production of Indonesian cocoa beans tripled to 31,600
tonnes in calendar 1986 from 10,284 tonnes in 1980. Output is
projected to rise to 50,000 tonnes in 1988 from 38,000 tonnes
this year as young trees mature.
    Both Malaysia and Indonesia are low cost producers and
traders said they could last out low prices longer than West
African countries.
    According to one Kuala Lumpur trader, world prices would
have to fall another 1,000 ringgit per tonne (about 250 stg) to
make cocoa production in Malaysia uneconomic.
    Some traders believe the main quality problem is with
harvesting and fermentation techniques.
    One trader said Malaysian cocoa is virtually
indistinguishable from West African output if treated in the
same way but this is not possible on the larger Malaysian
estates.

    However, he said Tokyo may consider such a measure if the

    He also told reporters the exchange will relax margin

    Takeuchi said the sharp fall in stock prices was mostly due
to psychological factors.
    "We need to keep close watch on market movement but we
expect the market will stabilise soon," he said, adding that
individual investors should remain calm. "It is advisable to
wait for an autonomous recovery of the market," he said.

    Takeuchi also said the exchange has no specific plan to

    The drop on Wall Street was caused by various factors but
was primarily the result of a correction of overvalued share
prices, he said. The current stock price plunge cannot compare

different, he added.
    The exchange has not changed plans to introduce stock

		<field name = "content">Finance Minister Roger Douglas said
the fall in share prices on local and world markets
demonstrated that New Zealand could not be isolated from global
trends.
    "We can't expect to isolate ourselves from developments
around the world," Douglas told reporters.
    "I think above all what today's problems illustrate is that
the sort of policies that we have been putting in place the
last three years are absolutely essential so that New Zealand's
economic performance improves, relative to the rest of the
world."
    The New Zealand share market fell 14.7 pct on Tuesday in a
record one-day fall.
    Douglas told a news conference, at which the government
announced plans to sell its 89 pct stake in New Zealand Steel
Ltd>, that the sharemarket fall would not affect plans to sell
parts of state-owned corporations such as Air New Zealand>,
DFC New Zealand Ltd> and Petroleum Corp of New Zealand Ltd>.
Asked if the government considered acting to close the
sharemarket for a period, Douglas said: "No. I'm not sure it
would have been my job to do so."

		<field name = "AUTHOR">By Linda Sieg</field>
		<field name = "content">Some economists fear a world recession if
stock exchanges continue to plunge. Others are more sanguine.
    The pessimists say the stocks shakeout is destroying
personal assets and dampening consumption.
    "The real economic effects can be significant -- the
destruction of wealth and a deflationary impact on the economy,"
said an economist at a U.S. Securities house.
    But other economists said such fears were overblown.
    "Because of lower appreciation of corporate or personal
assets, that much negative impact could be observed (in the
U.S.)," said Keikichi Honda, general manager of economic
research at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd.
    "But the appreciation of stock prices has not been playing
such a major role in the entire U.S. Gross national product
(GNP)," Honda said.
    The pessimists noted that the record fall on Wall Street on
Monday was sparked by fears the U.S. Economy is heading for a
recession or serious slowdown much earlier than expected.
    But the optimists said a dampening effect on consumption
due to stock market losses was less likely in Japan.
    "In Japan the weight of stocks in individuals' total assets
is less than in the U.S., And the total weight of individuals'
holdings in the stock market is less, so there will be less
damage than in the U.S.," said an economist at one of Japan's
major brokerage houses.
    "Japan is taking strong measures to stimulate domestic
demand, so while there could be some impact from the reduction
of assets value, it would not be a major impact," said the Bank
of Tokyo's Honda.
    Optimists also pointed to incipient declines in U.S.
Interest rates as a positive sign for the U.S. Economy.
    "U.S. Interest rates are coming down so there is a feeling
that interest rates have hit their ceiling, and the U.S.
Economy is strong, so there should be no direct impact from the
collapse of share prices," said Toshiaki Kakimoto, Sumitomo Bank
Ltd chief economist.
    Some economists suggested that should markets continue to
slump, the major industrial nations may have to discuss
possible joint lowering of official discount rates.
    "Until last week, a discussion of lower rates was
unthinkable, now it's not," said the Japanese brokerage house
economist.
    "There has been a move from the purely rational to the
emotional -- it's a central bankers' nightmare," said the
foreign economist. "It will require strong global leadership by
politicians to snuff out," he said.
    However, "previously, the stocks correction was due to fears
of higher interest rates, a possible resurgence of inflation
and the depreciation of the dollar," said Nobuyuki Ueda, senior
economist at the Long-Term Credit Bank Ltd.
    "Now some people have an uneasy feeling about the outlook of
the U.S. Economy," Ueda said.
    "If the stock market is a leading indicator of the future
movement of the economy, this decline will have very
significant implications for the U.S. Economy," he said.
    "If the low levels hold, those who were keeping consumption
high because of unrealised gains could curb consumption," said
Salomon Brothers (Asia) Ltd economist Ron Napier. "If the paper
gains aren't there, people won't spend."
    A U.S. Recession could then trigger similar declines in
other economies, some economists said.
    "I don't know if a possible recession in the U.S. Would
trigger a world recession because other nations, such as Japan,
are showing good economic performance," LTCB's Ueda said. "But we
can't rule out the possibility because the U.S. Is still
playing a very dominant role in the world economy."

		<field name = "AUTHOR">By Linda Sieg</field>
		<field name = "content">Government and monetary authorities today
staged a concerted effort to calm spreading panic on Japanese
stock exchanges but market analysts said there were limits to
their ability to succeed.
    "The ability of the Big Four (Japanese securities houses)
and the Finance Ministry is limited," said Barclays de Zoete
Wedd economist Peter Morgan.
    Finance Ministry officials asked the big four securities
companies this afternoon to help calm panic selling on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, ministry officials said.
    Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone was quoted by Kyodo News
Service as saying he was watching the stock market situation.
    But he rejected comparisons with the 1929 stock market
collapse and subsequent recession.
    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the Tokyo stock
market should not be gravely affected by downturns in New York
and London because there are clear signs of a Japanese economic
recovery and exchange rate stability.
    Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita also tried to calm
the panic, saying in a statement that world stock markets were
excessively concerned about the economic future.
    Traditionally, the four big houses  -- Nomura Securities Co
Ltd, Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd, Daiwa Securities Co Ltd, and
Nikko Securities Co Ltd -- have influenced the market because
of their sheer size and overwhelming market share.
    This strength has in the past made it possible for the
brokerages to calm down markets under guidance from the Finance
Ministry, analysts said.
    But the analysts questioned whether the brokerages, which
have already suffered heavy losses from falling bond markets
over the past year, would have the strength this time to turn
things around.
    "The question is, are the Japanese brokerages strong enough
to force investors to buy," said Johsen Takahashi, research
director at the Mitsubishi Research Institute.
    "If we consider that they have suffered serious losses in
the bond markets and in their U.S. Investments, it is debatable
whether they they could support buying," he said.
    "We can support things to some extent, but we can't
completely suppress selling," said one Japanese broker.
    Some analysts said the high percentage of shares cross-held
by financial institutions and other corporations could have a
stabilising effect on the market.
    Some 80 pct of shares are held by corporate shareholders,
said Keikichi Honda, general manager of the Bank of Tokyo Ltd's
economic research division. "This is a tightly woven textile. In
its own way it is stronger than Wall Street."
    But other analysts expressed doubt about this argument.
    "If a high percent of shares is cross held, everything
happens at the edges and the relative moves can be larger," said
Kleinwort Benson Ltd financial analyst Simon Smithson. "Selling
will drive prices down an enormous distance because of no
liquidity."
    "You don't need big volume to get big declines in the market
-- you just need a huge imbalance between sellers and buyers,"
said Barclay's Morgan.
    Shares held by what are termed "stable shareholders," or
banks and other companies with which a firm does business,
might also find their way onto the market if the outlook gets
bad enough, some analsyst said.
    "Closely held shares could become unclosely held," said
Morgan. But he said such a prospect is unlikely right now
because companies, with their improved earnings prospects, do
not need to sell shares for cash flow reasons.

		<field name = "content">Oil prices would skyrocket for a time if
conflict in the Gulf closed the Strait of Hormuz, but oil
supplies could be adjusted to take care of world demand,
Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said.
    He made no explicit reference to the latest U.S. Military
action in the Gulf.
    But in an address to a conference of the Indonesian
Petroleum Association, he said, "If worst comes to worst and say
the flow of oil through the Straits of Hormuz is completely
shut off, I believe the world oil supply, given time to adjust,
can take care of the situation."
    "But this is not to say that prices, at least for a short
duration, will not skyrocket as speculators take advantage of
the situation," he declared.
    Tensions in the Gulf, however, usually had a relatively
short-term impact on prices, he added.
    Assessing future price trends, he said, "Short-term spot
prices will probably still fluctuate, but they will most likely
hover around the official Opec price basket of 18 dlrs per
barrel.
    "The upward deviations, however, are likely to be greater
than the downward ones."
    "The balance between supply and demand in the short term
will still be delicate," he added. "Non-Opec production may still
go up, competing with Opec for the expected additional increase
in world demand."
    Subroto, a member of Opec's three-man quota committee which
has been touring cartel members, said speculation may play
havoc with spot prices, but Opec was trying to stabilize the
situation by urging cooperation by non-Opec producers.
    In the medium term, non-Opec production would reach a
plateau in the early 1990s, leaving Opec much stronger, he
said.

		<field name = "content">Rises in West German and international
interest rates are a cause for concern and the Bundesbank has
no interest in higher capital market rates, Bundesbank
President Karl Otto Poehl said.
    "We consider the interest rate increase that has occurred
here and internationally to be a problem and cause for concern,"
Poehl told an investment conference.
    "I would like to stress that the Bundesbank has no interest
in higher capital market rates," he said.
    Shortly after Poehl spoke, the Bundesbank announced a
tender for a securities repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80
pct.
    Previous tenders over the last month by interest rate have
seen the allocation rate on these facilities rise to 3.85 pct
at last week's pact from 3.60 on the last fixed-rate tender in
late September.
    The Bundesbank's reduction of the key allocation rate to
3.80 from 3.85 pct was heralded Monday by repeated injections
of money market liquidity at between 3.70 and 3.80 pct.
    These moves to cap interest rates followed a meeting
between Poehl, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker Monday in Frankfurt.
    Officials said afterwards the three men had reaffirmed
their commitment to the Louvre accord on currency stability.
    Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of the tightening in
West German monetary policy had prompted a sharp fall of the
dollar on speculation that Louvre cooperation had ended.
    But the dollar rallied on news of Monday's meeting in
nervous trading to trade above 1.79 marks Tuesday.
    Poehl said that the recent rise in interest rates was not
due to central bank policy, but to markets' expectations, and
currency developments.
    Commenting on the inflationary expectations, Poehl said "You
have to get to the root of the problem, you have to pursue a
policy which reveals that there are no grounds for such fears."
 The inflationary fears were unjustified and exaggerated, he
said.
    Poehl rebuffed recent U.S. Criticism of West Germany,
saying the Bundesbank had made a substantial contribution to
international cooperation in interest and monetary policy.
    The Bundesbank has tolerated an overshooting of its money
supply target, arousing criticism from other quarters, he said.
    "Today we still have lower interest rates than at the end of
1986... Quite the contrary of other countries, where interest
rates have risen substantially more," Poehl said.
    This had to be taken into account when considering recent
rises in repurchase pact allocation rates, which were due to
rising international money market rates that had spilled over
into the German market, he said.
    Poehl expressed surprise that financial markets had so far
ignored improvements in the U.S. Deficits.
    "The adjustment process in the U.S. Trade balance is
definitely underway," he said, noting that this was not so
noticeable in absolute figures.
    The spectacular improvement in the budget deficit had also
attracted little attention, he said.

    Lawson said in a BBC radio interview, "This began on Wall

a lack of confidence in the U.S. -  and some careless talk by

    He said he saw no fundamental signs why the U.S. Economy
should go into recession, adding, "Indeed the possibility of
higher (U.S.) interest rates would certainly in my judgment not
lead the American economy into a recession."
    "The only way in which the American economy would go into
recession was if it actually talks itself into recession," he
said.

		<field name = "AUTHOR">By Diane Stormont</field>
		<field name = "content">The Philippine coconut industry has
greeted with relief the defeat in the U.S. Senate of a bill
requiring some edible oils to be labelled as saturated fats.
    The bill, which was defeated by the Senate Agriculture
Committee on Monday, could have cost about 60 mln dlrs a year
in lost exports, the Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) said.
    "Naturally, we welcomed the defeat but there is a chance the
bill will be resurrected and attached as a rider to another
Senate bill," a spokesman for the United Coconut Association of
the Philippines (UCAP).
    PCA chairman Jose Romero noted the vote was close, with
eight senators voting for it, 10 against and one abstaining.
    The UCAP spokesman said the American Soybean Association
(ASA) had spent about 25 mln dlrs lobbying for the bill.
    He said the ASA also had obscured the health issue during
the debate.
    "Coconut oil is high in saturated fats, but unlike saturated
animal fats, they do not enter the blood and lymph systems
leaving fatty deposits connected to heart disease," he said.
    U.S. Soybean and cottonseed producers had argued that
saturated fats cause heart disease and that the labels would
discourage consumption by health conscious consumers in favour
of domestic unsaturated alternatives.
    Opponents of the bill said the proposal discriminated
against imports and would damage the Philippines, Malaysia and
Indonesia.
    The Philippines earned 488 mln dlrs from coconut products
in 1986, up from 477 mln in 1985, UCAP figures show.
    Exports to the United States for edible and non-edible use
account for about half of that total, PCA's Romero said.

		<field name = "AUTHOR">By Vithoon Amorn</field>
		<field name = "content">Thai stock prices plunged on Tuesday as
nervous investors unloaded shares on reports of steep declines
on major world stock markets.
    Brokers said the Securities Exchange of Thailand Index fell
a record 36.64 points, or nearly eight pct, to close at 422.37.
    "It's impossible to halt the slide in this situation. The
market just doesn't behave logically," said Sirivat
Voravetvuthikun, executive vice president of Asian Securities
Trading Co Ltd.
    But Sirivat said he did not believe the fall would mark the
end of the SET's 16 month bull run, which has accelerated
during the last two months. He expected Thai stocks to
fluctuate widely in the next few weeks.
    The slide on Tuesday followed a 13.85 point decline of the
97-stock index on Monday when it closed at 459.01.
    Brokers said they were flooded with sell orders when the
market opened this morning and a SET announcement urging
investors not to panic was ignored.
    The index reached a record 472.86 last Friday, up 57.7 pct
from end-June and 128.2 pct higher than last December.
    SET officials said 77 issues were traded on Tuesday, of
which all but two declined. Of the losers, 68 plummeted the
daily maximum 10 pct allowed by the exchange. Prices on the
special foreign column also fell sharply.
    SET vice president Suthichai Chitvanich told reporters the
10 pct floor serves as a restraint, making it unnecessary to
suspend trading should the panic continue.
    The Thai exchange has lately been gaining on its own
strength with most buying coming from local investors.
    Investors should not be unduly influenced by foreign market
reports, he added.
    Suthichai said sound local fundamentals, including low
interest rates and promising economic growth, favoured
investment in the stock market.
    The SET also announced it would release third quarter
corporate earnings earlier than expected as part of efforts to
shore up public confidence.

		<field name = "AUTHOR">By Rich Miller</field>
		<field name = "content">Plunging Tokyo stock prices will prevent
the Bank of Japan from raising its discount rate and could even
force it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues,
government and private economists said.
    A rise in interest rates now would only serve to spark
further selling of shares that could ultimately have a major
deflationary impact on the real economy, they said.
    Although Bank of Japan officials have consistently
maintained that they had no plans to raise the 2.5 pct discount
rate, many in the markets have thought otherwise. 
    Fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by the
central bank's apparent decision last week to countenance
higher rates on commercial bills, dealers said.
    But today's stock market collapse -- prices fell nearly 15
pct -- means that the Bank of Japan would be hard pressed to
raise the discount rate now, despite its concerns about a
renewed outbreak of inflation, dealers and economists said.
    Japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as the
markets concluded that the stock market's collapse precluded
the central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discount
rate increase.
    A senior government economist suggested that both the U.S.
And Japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent a
further drop in New York and Tokyo stock prices. "They need to
support the stock and security markets," he said.
    But Bank of Japan officials said they saw no need to change
policy for the moment, although one admitted that the central
bank may have to rethink its strategy if Tokyo stock prices
continue to plunge during the rest of the week.
    Both government and Bank of Japan economists agreed the
economy is better placed now to cope with the deflationary
impact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago.
    With the economy recovering strongly, the steep drop in
stock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer and
business confidence, one government economist said.
    "There will be some impact on the real economy, but it won't
be that big," said another.
    Individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on their
own, although they do participate through trust funds and other
investment vehicles. And while many manufacturing firms turned
to financial market investments for profits during last year's
economic downturn, the recent rebound has allowed them to
refocus their attention on their core businesses, he said.
    Paradoxically, it is the pick-up in the economy that is
partly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have
shifted funds away from financial investments to increase
inventories and step up capital spending, one government
economist said.
    In deciding what response to make to the steep stock price
drop, the Bank of Japan must first determine whether prices
will continue to fall further and then decide if they pose a
greater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation,
one central bank official said. "That will at least take a
couple of days, if not weeks," he said.

		<field name = "content">President Corazon Aquino said economic
growth took priority over debt repayments but she sought to
dispel fears that the Philippines would not honour a July
agreement rescheduling 13.2 billion dlrs of debt.
    In a speech to 13 major business groups, Aquino said, "Our
policy has been very clear fm the start -- growth must take
priority, for the plain and simple reason that if we have no
money to pay, we can't. And if we starve the nation of
essential services, there may be no one around to honour the
debt."
    Aquino said her officials would try to get all 483 creditor
banks to sign the debt rescheduling pact by the November 15
effective date.
    "That should end speculation and remove at least one excuse
for hoarding dollars," Aquino said.
    Violent fluctuations in the peso's exchange rate and the
end of a 17-month bull run in local stock markets have
triggered dollar-hoarding.
    Aquino said the country's foreign debt, which rose to
nearly 29 billion dlrs in April, was growing even without fresh
borrowing.
    Debt servicing took up 40 pct of the budget and 45 pct of
export earnings, Aquino said. Over the next six years, the
Philippines would be paying its creditors 20 billion dlrs while
getting only four billion dlrs in new loans.
    Aquino acknowledged there were grave doubts about her
government's ambitious privatisation program.
    "There is always an excuse for government not to sell," she
said, but she added: "I want government to get out of business."
She said non-performing assets would be sold in open bidding
and Filipinos and foreigners would compete on equal terms.

because of the unprecedented three-day drop in prices, which
has seen almost 23 pct wiped off share values.
    Trading on the Hong Kong market has been called off until
Monday because of the steep slide on Wall Street amid panic
selling on all the world's stock exchanges.
    The Tokyo market was 14.9 pct off last night after a huge
508 point (22.5 pct) fall on Wall Street yesterday.
    The Stock Exchange said although the Stock Exchange
Automated Quotation (SEAQ) system was working perfectly, "fast
market" conditions may pevail periodically.
    A "fast market" indicator is displayed at the bottom of the
SEAQ screen when the huge volume of activity is delaying prices
from entering the system, making screen prices lag behind the
prevailing market.
    Such conditions are reviewed every 30 minutes and at 1000
GMT were withdrawn and all on screen prices became firm.
    The Exchange said the mandatory quote period will still end
at 1600 GMT but depending upon trading activity the market
indices may again be calculated up to 1630 GMT instead of the
usual 1600 GMT.
    At 0945 GMT the FTSE 100 share index was down 259.1 points
at 1,793.2, 12.6 pct lower so far today.

		<field name = "content">East and West on Monday decided to go
ahead with an ambitious nuclear fusion project billed as
possibly providing an inexhaustible source of energy, the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said.
    Representatives of the U.S., The Soviet Union, the European
Community and Japan agreed to develop plans for a revolutionary
thermonuclear reactor, to produce energy not from splitting
atoms as in today's nuclear plants, but by joining them.
    Work is due to begin next year at the Institute for Plasma
Physics at the Max Planck Foundation near Munich, West Germany,
and is scheduled for completion by 1990, an IAEA statement
said.
    Research into fusion's scientific feasibility has been
under way for many years but the project approved on Monday,
known as International Thremonuclear Experimental Reactor
(ITER) will study if an actual plant could be built.
    The project represents an unprecedented display of
East-West scientific cooperation, but a decision will not be
made until its completion on whether an actual reactor would be
jointly constructed or by individual participant countries.
    Dieter Sigmar, a leading U.S. Fusion researcher, said last
month that the development of a demonstration plant would cost
several billion dlrs and need at least another 10 years.
    Fusion plants would produce little radioactive waste.
    While today's nuclear power plants need uranium, mined in
only a few countries and producing dangerous waste, fusion
plants would eventually run only on deuterium, an element
related to hydrogen and available from almost limitless
supplies of sea water, according to experts.

		<field name = "AUTHOR">By Tsukasa Maekawa</field>
		<field name = "content">Former Finance Minister Noboru Takeshita,
chosen on Monday to be Japan's next prime minister, will face a
tough test in managing Japan's economy from the very start of
his two-year term, economists and businessmen said.
    Takeshita told a news conference on Tuesday that he would
do his best to continue the domestic reforms and external
policies of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.
    However, leading Japanese businessmen called on Takeshita
to outdo Nakasone by showing stronger leadership.
    "Takeshita should not merely follow the Nakasone policies
but should cope with mounting economic issues with a new vision
and policies," Takashi Ishihara, chairman of the Japan Committee
for Economic Development, said in a statement.
    Economists generally agreed that there will be no major
changes in Japan's economic policies under a new leader.
    However, expectations are high among major industries for
new initiatives by Takeshita for immediate and effective
measures to solve economic problems such as trade friction with
the U.S., Administrative and tax reforms, and soaring land
prices.
    Eishiro Saito, chairman of the Federation of Economic
Organisations (Keidanren), urged Takeshita to succeed in
unifying the ruling Liberal Democratic Party as soon as
possible to tackle difficult tasks.
    Regarding foreign economic polices, Yoshitoki Chino,
chairman of the Japan Securities Dealers Association, said
Takeshita should come up with economic measures well before
economic issues develop into problems.
    Behind those calls on Takeshita for prompt action are
doubts about his capability in handling international issues
due to his lack of experience in diplomacy, economists said.
     Economists said foreign countries should be patient with
Takeshita, who is widely known as an ultra-cautious politician.
    Takeshita has repeatedly said, "There should be consensus
before taking action."
    Takeshita has so far failed to unveil specific measures to
reduce Japan's huge trade surplus, economists said.
    He has said Japan will continue to stimulate the economy
and to open the market wider to foreign products.

		<field name = "AUTHOR">By James Kynge</field>
		<field name = "content">The massive plunge in Tokyo stock prices on
Tuesday could rob the Government of much-needed revenue to spur
Japan's economy, and may hurt banks' ability to lend abroad,
analysts polled by Reuters said.
    "The Japanese Government is depending on the sale of NTT
(Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp NCCT.T>) shares for much
of its public spending budget," said Shigeo Suzuki, a deputy
general manager at the Industrial Bank of Japan.
    Japan had hoped to raise at least 5,000 billion yen from
the sale of 1.95 mln NTT shares on November 10.
    However, the 14.9 pct plunge in the Tokyo share index today
has made such plans look unrealistic, analysts said.
    "The government could defer the sale of NTT or they could
offer fewer shares," said Keikichi Honda, general manager of
economic research at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd.
    Honda said another possibility is that the underwriters
handling the NTT sale would have to pay the Government the
amount it expected to get and bear the brunt of any losses
themselves. "That is what underwriting means," he added.
    A Finance Ministry official confirmed that the government
planned to go ahead with its sale of NTT shares on November 10.
    Another possible effect of Tokyo's stock tumble would be to
seriously undermine the asset base of Japanese banks.
    The banks lend money all over the world and regard the
market value of stock holdings as assets, analysts said.
    "Japanese banks make loans using perhaps as much as 60 to 70
pct of the market value of their unrealised stock holdings as
assets," said Industrial Bank's Suzuki.
    There is also concern that Japanese companies, which have
invested heavily in Tokyo's stocks as their real business
declined over the last two years, have sustained heavy losses.
    "Many companies, mainly export-oriented companies, were
planning on selling their shares for a profit to reinvest in
real businesses as the economy begins to pick up," said one
analyst at a foreign brokerage. "That prospect now looks dim."
    But analysts said it is unlikely companies or financial
institutions will be bankrupted by losses in stock trading.
    "I don't think any company is so badly exposed in stock
investments," said a senior analyst at Nomura Research
Institute. "In terms of financial institutions, luckily the
rebounding bond market and currency markets are still
profitable," he added.
    The Nomura analyst said a 10 pct decline in Tokyo stocks
would be translated into a fall of about 0.2 pct in consumer
spending. Some 20 pct of Tokyo stocks are owned by individuals.
    Market capitalisation on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell to
329,588 billion yen on Tuesday from 386,041 billion at Monday's
close.
    NTT shares ended 260,000 yen lower at 2.65 mln each, well
down from their peak of 3.18 mln in April.

    The main issue at the talks, which opened here yesterday,

buffer stock manager should continue to sell rubber after the
current international pact for the commodity expires on October
22, they said.
    The deadline for the start of the new pact is January 1989.
    Buffer stock manager Aldo Hofmeister has been mandated to
continue selling rubber during the interim period.
    Other issues discussed include ratification of the new
accord, the officials said.
    Only Malaysia of the pact's 32 producing and consuming
member countries had ratified the new agreement by the
beginning of this month.

spokesman said.
    The spokesman said the discovery was made at the GOS IA-1
offshore exploratory well about 38 kms east of Langsa in Aceh.
    "Oil and gas are found in sand layers at the depth of 2,300
metres within the Baong formation," he said.
    He said preliminary tests showed that the well could flow
oil at the rate of 1,320 barrels a day with 50 degrees API at
20 degrees centigrade through a 5/8 inch choke.
    "The well also flows natural gas at the rate of 12 mln
standard cubic feet a day," he added.
    GOS IA-1 well, located at a water depth of 41 metres, was
drilled under a production sharing contract between Pertamina
and Japex North Sumatra Ltd, each having 50 pct shares.
    "Petroleum operations are to be carried out by Pertamina as
operator through a joint operating body established by the two
companies," the Pertamina spokesman stated.
    The contract covers the Gebang block contract area. The two
companies have previously completed the drilling of GOS IIA-1
exploratory well, around 14 kms south of GOS IA-1.

		<field name = "content">Indonesia told the oil industry on
Tuesday it will extend contracts on producing blocks and
improve the investment climate, but wants to see increased
expenditure on exploration in return.
    President Suharto, in an opening speech to the Indonesian
Petroleum Association, said Indonesia was ready to extend
contracts held by foreign oil companies on producing areas.
    "In order to boost investment in the petroleum industry, the
government of Indonesia has basically approved of extending
production sharing contracts under the present laws," Suharto
said.
    "Apart from that, the government will keep improving the
investment climate in order to accelerate the development of
the petroleum industry," he said.
    Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto told the Association he
was aware that the oil industry needed to be assured that
contracts on blocks expiring within the next 10 years would be
renewed before they would invest in further exploration.
    "As we all have heard this morning, the President is fully
aware of this situation," Subroto said.
    "The government has already made the political decision to
entertain this time problem by inviting the existing producers
to continue their activities in Indonesia, albeit on a
selective basis."
    Indonesia, one of the 13 members of OPEC, must find new oil
reserves if it is to remain an exporter in the next decade, oil
industry sources say.
    Subroto said the government was also working to ease other
problems, including granting easier terms for remote areas or
deep water conditions.
    But Subroto said relations with oil companies were two-way
and that they should step up expenditure on oil exploration now
that the oil price had recovered.
    President Suharto said he wanted to see greater transfer of
technology to Indonesian companies, and more help from the oil
industry for the regions in which companies operated.
    Abdul Rachman Ramly, the President of state oil company
Pertamina, has said that budgeted exploration and production
expenditure for all oil companies in Indonesia was forecast to
fall to 3.1 billion dlrs in calendar 1987 from 3.4 billion in
1986.
    Pertamina has 69 production-sharing or joint operation
contracts with foreign oil companies.
    Subroto said speeding up necessary approvals for field
operations was a government priority. There had been
misunderstandings between the government and the oil industry
in certain areas, such as when a field is designated
commercial, and a thorough evaluation was being made.
    He said the government wanted to finalise contract
extensions as soon as practical, and urged the industry in the
meantime to maintain its exploration drive.
    Subroto said Indonesia needed the companies to maintain
exploration efforts, even if their contract was due to expire
within 10 years. "This need in itself is some sort of guarantee
that we will soon have to come up with an extension agreement."
    Eleven major contract areas are due to come up for renewal
between 1991 and 2001, industry sources said.
    Extension of the contracts on the blocks has involved
detailed negotiations but so far no extension has been granted.
    Subroto told reporters afterwards that contract extensions
would be selective, based on how much capital would be
invested.

		<field name = "content">Stockbrokers and legislators welcomed
the suspension of trading on the local market after Monday's
record fall, but some said the suspension was too long and
could harm the territory's reputation as a financial centre.
    Announcing the suspension until next Monday, stock exchange
chairman Ronald Li said earlier today "This will protect
investors and allow brokers to settle a backlog of orders."
    But legislator David Li, who is also managing director of
the Bank of East Asia, while weloming the move, said a one-day
halt would have been enough.
    "I believe the exchange is over-reacting. A long suspension
will damage Hong Kong's reputation as a financial centre and
hurt foreign investors' confidence," David Li said.
    Legislator Hui Yin-fat echoed this view. "What will they do
if the market resumes its fall next week ?" he asked.
    Legislator Lee Yu-tai said small investors would be
hard-hit by the decision. He said some were paying interest on
loans to purchase stock and a long suspension increased their
losses.
    Financial Secretary Piers Jacobs said the decision was
explainable, but he added, "It does seem rather a long time."
    However, George Tan, assistant director of Greenwell
Montagu (Far East) Ltd, said the suspension was wise. "Hong Kong
is a volatile market and this will let things settle down," he
said.
    Other brokers agreed. "At least this gives us a bit of
breathing space," said one.
    John MacKenzie, chairman of the Hong Kong Association of
Banks, said "I feel that it is not at all a bad thing that
investors and investment mnanagers be given a breathing space."
    Hong Kong's main share indicator, the Hang Seng index, fell
420.81 points to 3,362.39 on Monday - its biggest ever one-day
fall in real terms.

		<field name = "content">Iran is preparing lawsuits to file for
compensation from the U.S. Over the American raid on its Gulf
oil platforms, Tehran radio quoted Iranian Oil Minister
Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying.
    The lawsuits would be filed with competent international
bodies once the exact damage was calculated, he was quoted
telling a news conference in Tehran. He earlier estimated the
damage from the U.S. Raid at about 500 mln dlrs.
    The rigs, one of which was heavily shelled by four American
destroyers on Monday, were still burning almost 24 hours after
the attack, he said.
    Aqazadeh said the half-billion-dollar damage estimate was
preliminary. Washington has said the attack was in response to
a missile strike against the American-flag tanker the Sea Isle
City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.
    He denied that there was any military hardware on the rigs
"except a 23 mm machinegun for air defence." Reacting to
Weinberger's remark that Washington considered the case closed,
Aqazadeh said: "Iran will also consider the case closed after
its retaliatory measure." Iranian officials have said their
response would not be limited to the Gulf and U.S. Interests
around the world might come under attack.
    Aqazadeh said the U.S. Military presence in the Gulf
aggravated the regional crisis and made access to the region's
oil more difficult, but he did not see the U.S. Attack
significantly affecting oil prices.
    IRNA said he gave no explicit reply when asked if the
attack would prompt Iran to block the Hormuz Strait at the
entrance to the Gulf.
    "If Iran cannot use the Hormuz Strait, no other country can
either, and this would be to everyone's harm," the radio quoted
him as saying.

a billion dlrs of its own capital available to mutual funds to
enable them to sell securities for cash if they need to do so,
a senior spokesman for the investment banking firm said.
    The spokesman said Goldman took the decision on its own
initiative on Tuesday morning after a number of mutual funds
had reported a cash squeeze because of a flood of redemptions
by stock market investors.
    The New York Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange
Commission were informed of the move, he said.
    The spokesman described the action as an effort to be
helpful. "We're not trying to encourage them to liquidate, but
if it's needed, the money's there," he said.
    The provision of one billion dlrs poses no undue burden on
Goldman Sachs's capital, the spokesman said.

Inc said they are cutting their prime lending rate to 9-1/4 pct
from 9-3/4 pct, reversing an increase that they announced just
last week.
    The reduction is effective immediately.
    No other major U.S. bank had followed the lead of Chemical
and Marine Midland, preferring to keep their prime rates at
9-1/4 pct while they waited to see what course money market
rates would take.
    Following Monday's record fall in Wall Street stock prices,
money market rates fell sharply on Tuesday as investors
ploughed proceeds into short-term instruments and the Federal
Reserve said it is prepared to provide liquidity to support the
economy and the financial system.
    Eurodollar deposit rates in London fell by as much as 9/16
percentage point, Treasury bill rates fell by as much as half a
point (after falling between 59 and 84 basis points on Monday),
and the Fed funds rate dropped to 7-1/4 pct from Monday's
average of 7.61 pct. Speculation even surfaced of a discount
rate cut to calm the markets, dealers said.

said the recent decline in equities has had a dislocating

    The company reported a drop in third quarter profits to 51
mln dlrs from 65 mln dlrs on increased revenues of 1.3 billion
dlrs compared to 1.1 billion a year earlier.
    "While the decline in equities in recent weeks has had a
dislocating effect on the market in general," Chairman Peter A.
Cohen said, "it has not had an impact on our financial
condition."
   
    Cohen said Shearson's third quarter earnings reflected the
diversity of its revenues and "progress in several core
businesses resulting in higher commission, investment banking
and investment advisory revenues. These improvements were
offset by a decline in revenues from market making and
principle transactions and an increase in expenses from year
ago levels," it said.

		<field name = "titulo">U.S. COFFEE IMPORT REPORTING SYSTEM QUESTIONED</field>
		<field name = "AUTHOR">BY Susan Zeidler</field>
		<field name = "content">A voluntary compliance system for
monitoring U.S. coffee imports under quotas is viewed
skeptically by many in the coffee industry, said analysts and
trade sources.
    "Many sectors of the trade, including large roasters and 
importers, are adamant against voluntary compliance because of
the past, which was subject to tremendous irregularities as it
became a matter of the trade monitoring each other," one
analyst said.
    On Monday, a National Coffee Association newsletter said
the Office of U.S. Trade Representative will implement a
voluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation to
monitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill.
    Under the arrangement, milar to one in 1980, coffee
importers would voluntarily present needed documents to the
U.S. government until Congress approves the monitoring
authority, but if coffee arrives without valid certification,
it will still be allowed entry.
    While many believe producers will not seek to add to the
overburdened stock situation in the U.S., others believe some
will ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu of
monitoring controls, trade sources said.
    "Last time, there was a lot of false information submitted
to customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines," a
U.S. Customs spokesman said.
    "Customs can do a good job when given the tools, but when
its hands are tied, it doesn't have the authority to demand
Form O (documents tracking merchandise from source to
destination)," he said.
    Many see it as a true test of whether producers and
importers will abide by the quota system.
    "It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in the
quota agreement," said one major U.S. roaster.
     "Last time we had a gentleman's agreement, the trade did
not act as a gentleman," said another analyst adding, "without
the need to submit documents, the ball will be in the
producers' hands."
    Some feel that importers will take advantage of the
voluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market,
in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount.
Many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-member
countries at discounts and then bring it into the U.S. falsely
labelled.
    According to customs officials, several green coffee
importers confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffee
fraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations,
forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navy
beans.
    "If there's that much of a discrepancy between prices for
one country and another, producers may be teted to get rid of
their stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and by
circumventing the quota provisions," said Paine Webber analyst
Bernie Savaiko.
    Still, others believe that producers will not be hard
pressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation in
the U.S. in the near term.
    "It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would not
have some share of connivance, but I think the voluntary system
seemed to suffice and, coupled with the fact that we have so
much coffee, I don't think that it poses that much of a
threat," one trader said.

		<field name = "content">The White House said the federal
budget deficit for fiscal 1988 will total 163 billion dlrs if
Congress and the administration fail to agree on a legislative
package of deficit reduction measures prior to a Nov. 20
deadline.
    In a report issued under the requirements of new balanced
budget legislation approved by Congress in September, the White
House budget office predicted the government would take in 903
billion dlrs in revenues and spend 1.066 trillion during fiscal
1988, which began Oct. 1.
    Under the terms of the new law, the government's failure to
agree on a deficit reduction package by Nov. 20 would trigger
across-the-board spending cuts of 23 billion dlrs.
    The White House report said this would reduce those defense
spending programs covered by the legislation by 10.5 pct and
would cut domestic programs by 8.5 pct.
    This magnitude of reductions would shear 11.5 billion dlrs
from defense and 11.5 billion dlrs from domestic programs.
    The Congressional budget Office last week estimated the
1988 budget deficit at 179.3 billion dlrs.

deals in exceptionally heavy turnover of around 590 mln crowns.
    "It was necessary to extend trading hours as the call-over
went on beyond two o'clock," she said.

		<field name = "content">Oilmeal demand remained strong in the
United States in July and August and six pct up on levels seen
in the same months last year, with most of the rise coming in
soymeal, the Hamburg based publication Oil World said.
    Total U.S domestic usage of the nine major oilmeals rose to
a record 19 mln tonnes in October 1986/August 1987, up 4.2 pct
on the same year-ago period, with the increase in soymeal at
seven pct, it said.
    Soviet soymeal demand rose by 310,000 tonnes in July and
330,000 tonnes in August over the respective year-ago months
following a huge increase in soymeal imports.
    Oil World presumed some imports were not used immediately
but went into stocks. With imports again large in September, it
estimated Soviet soymeal stocks sharply up at 800,000 tonnes by
October 1 from around 130,000 at the same time last year.
    EC oilmeal demand rose 100,000 tonnes in August from a year
earlier, with soymeal up 45,000 tonnes. Crushings of rapeseed,
sunseed and soybeans will probably rise from last year due to
bumper EC crops. It estimated the EC rapeseed crop at a record
5.9 mln tonnes, up from 3.7 mln last year. Rapeseed disposals
were reported at 2.1 mln tonnes by September 20 against 1.4 mln
at that time last year.

    Corrections said the two 500-bed facilities are scheduled
to be opened within one year of final contract signing at an
total capital investment of about 27 mln dlrs to be financed

    Based on its proposal, the company said, the facilities

    According to Texas law, Corrections said, any private

moves it said were designed to preserve stockholder protection

to the plan, modify the definition of "continuing directors"
and permit amendment or termination of the plan with the
consent of the company's shareholders if there are no
continuing directors in office or the approval of at least
three such directors cannot be obtained.
    The company also said it approved a certificate of
designation with respect to its 4.5 mln shares of authorized,
but previously undesignated and unissued shares of preferred
stock and adopted an employee stock ownership plan.
    Crazy Eddie also that it requested that the shareholder
group make a commitment not to take the company private until
Crazy Eddie has had a chance to recover from current financial
difficulties, a committment that the group rejected.

		<field name = "content">The Soviets have not indicated an
urgent need for a U.S. wheat subsidy offer, and it is unlikely
that such an offer will be ma during the U.S./Soviet summit
expected to be held next month, Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng told Reuters.
    In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Lyng said he did
not know if the United States will offer Moscow another wheat
subsidy offer this year or when that offer will be made.
    "Last year it was well into the year before we offered it.
There's been nothing that's taken place to indicate to me that
there's a pressing need on their part for that sort of deal (a
wheat subsidy)."
    When asked if a subsidy would be offered at a U.S./Soviet
summit, Lyng said, "No, I don't think so. I don't think that."
    The Agriculture Secretary said a U.S. wheat subsidy deal to
Moscow would not be the kind of topic appropriate for
discussion at a summit.
    "It would not be the kind of issue that the President or the
Chairman would get into specific negotiations or discussions
about," Lyng said.
    "When Mr. Nikonov (communist party secretary for
agriculture) was here ... he indicated that trade in wheat was
not something that would be discussed with the President of the
United States. He said it's not presidential," Lyng said.
    Lyng said uncertainties about wheat quality in some major
producing areas of the world, volatile wheat prices and the
still unfinished Soviet grain harvest could delay any final
decision on the timing of another wheat subsidy to Moscow.
    The future of the U.S./Soviet long-term grains agreement
will be discussed the first of next year, Lyng said, but the
Agriculture Secretary questioned the benefits of the
long-standing agreement.
    "We've had three years in a row in which the Soviets have
failed to live up to their end of the agreement ... We would
love to continue to keep doing busines with the Soviet Union,
but do we need a long-term agreement. Who benefits from that.
These are some of the questions we need to discuss."
    When asked if he felt the United States has benefitted from
the agreement, Lyng said, "I don't know. It certainly hasn't
been what we had hoped it would be. For three years running
they've (Moscow) failed to live up to what we considered was an
agreement."

		<field name = "content">The United States and India have
not yet agreed on a food aid package to help the
drought-stricken Asian country, Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng said.
    Lyng told Reuters in an interview that the two countries
have been discussing a package but that he did not expect the
specifics of the offer to be announced during Indian Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi's visit here this week.
    "We have been talking about the potential needs that India
might have for both their commercial market and purchases needs
as well as the possibilities of assistance," Lyng said.
    "At this point, there is no detailed plan or program. The
amounts of what commodities are uncertain. But we have
indicated to the Indians that we stand ready to assist in
whatever way they deem most valuable," he said.
    There has been speculation in trade circles that USDA would
offer India subsidized vegetable oil under the export
enhancement program and donate surplus corn under Section 419
of an amended 1949 law.
    Lyng indicated the two countries have been unable to agree
on the mix of concessional and commercial aid, and that
Washington would prefer the package include something other
than donated food.
    "The Indians are capable of purchasing a lot, of taking care
of themselves. India is a country that has come a long way in
its ability to produce food and they have a great pride in
that," Lyng said.
    "We (the United States) obviously, with the surpluses we
still have of many commodities..., would like to share in the
import business the Indians do, and then we have some, as we
always do, compassion for the people of India and would like to
cooperate with them," he said.
    Lyng said he had no plans to meet with Indian officials
during Gandhi's visit here, adding, "I just don't know of
anything that might be announced specifically."
    Asked if "the ball was in the Indians' court," he said, "Yes."
    Gandhi is to leave Washington Tuesday evening.

projects a 1.3 billion franc surplus, the Finance Ministry
announced.
    Income is expected to rise 11.6 mln francs to 27.22
billion, while expenditure is seen increasing 7.1 mln to 25.95
billion next year. After internal transfers, net income was
planned to total 637 mln francs.
    The ministry also announced that higher than expected
income during 1987 would likely boost this year's surplus
significantly higher than the 171 mln francs budgeted.
    The ministry said the encouraging development of
Switzerland's finances was due to steady economic growth since
1983 and the government's conservative fiscal policy.
    Although the dollar's weakness is likely to dampen economic
growth slightly in 1988 by depressing exports, domestic
investment and consumer demand were expected to remain strong.
    Real gross national product growth was seen rising two pct,
while annual inflation was also projected to reach two pct.

		<field name = "AUTHOR">By Rowena Whelan</field>
		<field name = "content">U.S. And West German reaffirmation of
support for the Louvre Accord cannot cure the fundamental
problems bedevilling the world economy which lie behind the
current collapse in stock markets, London economists said.
    "There's going to have to be some acknowledgement that the
dollar is going to be allowed to slip," said Richard Jeffrey of
Hoare Govett. "If not, there is going to be continued fear that
when pressure emerges on the dollar, the Fed will be forced to
tighten. This throws up the economic abyss of recession in the
U.S. With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world."
    But some economists added that Wall Street's crash, which
dragged other major markets down with it, may help curb the
very problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflation
fears and the massive and persistent U.S. Trade deficits.
    "If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street
...It's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide," said
Geoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel, echoing comments from
other London and Tokyo analysts.
    Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears of
further falls should dampen credit growth, curbing inflationary
pressures and import demand in the U.S., They say.
    Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist the
equity crash, according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson.
    "It would be suicidal for any government in the context of
what happened in the last couple of days to jack up their
interest rates," he added.
    Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its prime
lending rate half a point to 9.25 pct Tuesday and U.S. Fed
chairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financial
system.
    The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stock
collapse would spill over into the economy, via a banking
crisis for example, thus precipitating recession.
    It also helped the dollar rally sharply, to a high of
1.8200 marks from a European low of 1.7880. But economists said
today's whiplash moves do not have long term significance and
that markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals in
mind.
    "The United States has been able to live on borrowed time.
If the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economic
growth not recession...It contains good news (and) provides a
more realistic assessment of the U.S. Economy," said Capel's
Dennis. But he added that markets are still very much in
danger.
    "The liquidity doesn't disappear...All it's doing is
disappearing from the equity markets," Dennis noted.
    David Morrison of Goldman Sachs International said world
market turbulence will be exacerbated if the Group of Seven
(G-7) leading western nations confirms a base for the dollar,
as implied by West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg's remarks that intervention to support currencies
is still on.
    Last week's dollar fall was partly triggered by
expectations that the Germans were more worried about the money
supply impact of such intervention than maintaining currency
stability.
    But rigid adherence to dollar ranges would be bad, said
Morrison. "The Louvre Accord is fundamentally misconceived. To
stabilise the dollar at too high a level is wrong," he said.

		<field name = "AUTHOR">By Sandy Critchley</field>
		<field name = "content">An unexpectedly heavy 4.4 billion stg
surge in U.K. September sterling bank lending is unlikely to
nudge the Bank of England towards tightening monetary policy as
long as sterling remains in its present robust state,
economists said.
    An acute crisis of confidence in equity markets over the
past two days will in any case subdue personal consumer credit
demand which has largely been behind growth in lending.
    "In the normal course of events the markets would have been
extremely worried about that figure," noted Peter Spencer, U.K.
Economist with Credit Suisse First Boston.
    After an initial dip in reaction to the bank lending data,
which compared won stg August rise, U.K.
Government bonds (gilts) soared as investors continued to flee
from plummetting equities into the relative security of
government securities.
    Equity markets dropped sharply on the news, touching a
day's low of 1,766.7 on the FTSE 100 index after the data,
before staging a recovery. Sterling held its buoyant tone
throughout.
    U.K. Money market rates, in a similarly calm response,
resumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morning
after little more than a token blip as the figures came out.
    Noting that such a huge rise in credit extended by banks
would under other circumstances have prompted market fears of a
rise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct, "With
the financial markets doing what they're doing, that's the last
thing the Bank of England would want to do," Spencer said.
    "The monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long as
sterling is firm, the authorities are unlikely to put rates up,"
said Kevin Boakes, chief U.K. Economist at Greenwell Montagu
Gilt Edged. Boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow money
measure M0 to 5.2 pct year-on-year from August's 4.5 pct
growth, which he said must cause some concern at the Treasury.
    But "The fact that overall broad money growth has slowed
down is a rather encouraging sign," noted Paul Temperton, U.K.
Economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. He pointed to a
fall in the year-on-year growth rate of the M3 broad money
aggregate to 19.5 pct in September from August's 22 pct.
    It was concern about credit growth which prompted the Bank
of England to engineer a one point rise in U.K. Bank base rates
to 10 pct in early August, caution endorsed subsequently by
news of a massive 4.9 billion stg July rise in bank lending.
    Temperton noted that a particular focus of bank worry in
that period had been the behaviour of U.K. Asset markets.
    Housing and equities were the key two asset markets in
influencing consumer behaviour, he said.
    In the light of the precipitous falls on U.K. Equity
markets in the past few days, "There will almost certainly be a
straightforward impact on consumer spending and on retail
sales," Temperton said.
    "Almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth in
consumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues," he added.
    "I think the stock market has decided that the bank lending
figure is a thing of the past...We are talking about a very
serious panic and a flight to quality," Spencer said.
    A U.K. Treasury official said that it was important to look
at all the monetary information, not just the bank lending,
adding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowly
than bank lending.
    Senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lending
was evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavy
personal sector borrowing.
    Figures from the Banking Information Service showed
personal sector lending by U.K. Clearing banks rose by 1.66
billion stg in September after a 978 mln stg August rise. Much
of the rise reflected quarterly interest payments.

		<field name = "content">Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves, bouyed
by rising exports, have hit a record high and are likely to
soar to 72 billion U.S. Dlrs by the year end, central bank
officials said Tuesday.
    Central Bank Governor Chang Chi-cheng told reporters the
reserves totalled about 69 billion U.S. Dlrs, compared with
about 42 billion at the same time last year and 68 billion on
October 5. He declined to elaborate.
    A senior bank official, who declined to be named, told
Reuters the reserves were likely to reach 72 billion dlrs at
the end of the year.
    "The surge in reserves is the result of our trade surplus
and recent purchases of U.S. Dollars on the local interbank
market," Chang said.
    Taiwan's trade surplus hit a record 14.95 billion U.S. Dlrs
in the first nine months of 1987 compared with 11.05 billion a
year earlier, official figures show.
    Vice Economic Minister Wang Chien-hsien said the surplus
will rise to about 20 billion dlrs by the end of the year.
About 80 pct of the surplus will come from the island's trade
with the United States. 
    Chien said Taiwan's trade will reach 80 billion U.S. Dlrs
this year compared with 63.96 billion last year.
    Its exports are expected to total 50 billion and imports 30
billion against exports of 39.79 billion and imports of 24.17
billion last year.

		<field name = "titulo">NORWAY BOOSTS OIL OUTPUT BY 22 PCT IN SEPTEMBER</field>
		<field name = "content">Norway's September oil output rose by 22.2
pct to 1.07 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 830,492 bpd in
August, according to a Reuter survey of firms operating here.
    Operators said the sharp rise reflected higher output at
several of Norway's biggest fields and resumed production at
fields shut down for 27 days in August for the Ekofisk field
rescue project.
    Industry analysts said the increase did not exceed Norway's
voluntary move to curb by 7.5 pct planned growth in its oil
output, a move designed to back OPEC-led efforts to stabilise
oil prices by limiting supplies to world crude markets.
    Norway, not an OPEC member, decided in June to extend the
production restraints, enforced since February 1 1987, on all
its North Sea fields for the rest of the year.
    Oil Minister Arne Oeien said last month he expected Norway
would extend into 1988 its policy of slowed production growth.
    The biggest increase was seen on the Ekofisk field, which
pumped 168,023 bpd in September against 48,195 bpd in August,
field operator Phillips Petroleum Norway Inc said.
    Ekofisk and the nearby Valhall and Ula fields, which use
the Ekofisk pipeline, were shut down for most of August while
Phillips raised Ekofisk platforms to counter seabed subsidence.
    BP Petroleum Development Norway Ltd, operator of the Ula
field, said September output rose to 86,727 bpd after dropping
to 27,237 bpd in August because of the shutdown.
    Valhall, operated by Amoco Norway A/S, flowed 74,694 bpd
last month compared with 69,748 bpd in August, the company
said.
    September production was also sharply higher at the
Statfjord field. Norway's 84 pct share of Statfjord, which
extends into the British North Sea sector, was 611,138 bpd
against 552,646 bpd in August, operator Den Norske Stats
Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) said.
    Norway's 22.2 pct share of the Murchison field which, like
Statfjord, extends into the British sector, yielded 15,388 bpd
in September, a slight 920 bpd decrease from the previous
month, Norwegian partners on the British-operated field said.
    Statoil boosted output at its Gullfaks field to 109,670 bpd
in September, compared with 100,188 in August.
    Norsk Hydro, operator of the Oseberg field, said test
output at the field from the mobile production ship Petro Jarl
totalled 1,719 bpd last month, down sharply from 16,170 bpd in
August.
    Hydro said the drop was caused by failure to bring on
stream a second well, cutting September production to just two
days.

		<field name = "content">Assets of Offshore Banking Units (OBUs)
in Bahrain rose 11 pct in the second quarter of 1987 to reach
the highest level since early 1985, Bahrain Monetary Agency
(BMA) figures show.
    The BMA's quarterly statistical bulletin gave no reason for
the sharp rise, but economists said banks appeared to be
staying liquid because of the escalation of the Gulf crisis.
They said banks are parking funds in interbank markets outside
Bahrain.
    Despite the rise in assets, banks in Bahrain have been
retrenching operations considerably. At the end of 1986 there
were 68 OBUs compared with 74 at the end of 1985.
    BMA figures show OBU assets rose to 58.30 billion dlrs at
the end of June from 52.53 billion at the end of March and
55.68 billion at the end of 1986. The mid-1987 figure was the
highest since early 1985 when assets topped 61 billion.
    The second quarter rise came almost entirely in OBU assets
outside Bahrain. The volume of loans to the non-bank sector
declined slightly, indicating a still sluggish economy in the
region, economists said.

		<field name = "content">Tribune Co said a pre-tax charge of 16.7
mln dlrs or 11 cts a share in employee severance costs at the
New York Daily News led to a 73 pct decline in the company's
1987 third-quarter earnings.
    Tribune reported net income of 33,085,000 dlrs or 42 cts a
share, down from 123,450,000 dlrs or 1.53 dlrs in the 1986
third quarter.
    The company also said its 1986 third-quarter results were
boosted by a one-time pre-tax gain of 145 mln dlrs or 1.11 dlrs
a share from sale of its cable television systems.
    After adjusting for these extraordinary items, Tribune
President Stanton Cook said 1987 year-end should be strong.
    "Overall, we expect Tribune company's earnings before
non-recurring factors to show solid improvement for 1987," Cook
said.
    A 14 pct increase in newsprint prices since the 1986 third
quarter depressed newspaper publishing operating profits, the
company said. They were up only slightly at 46.1 mln dlrs after
adjusting for Daily News severance costs, from 45 mln dlrs in
the 1986 quarter, it said.
    Increased efficiency at the Tribune's two paper mills,
however, contributed to a 56 pct gain in newsprint operating
profits to 21.8 mln dlrs from 14 mln dlrs, it said.

		<field name = "content">Switzerland will use most of its budget
surplus projected for 1988 to redeem its debt, the Finance
Ministry said.
    The government's plan calls for income to exceed
expenditure by 1.3 billion Swiss francs next year. After
internal transfers, net income was seen reaching 637 mln
francs.
    The ministry said in a press release the surplus would be
used "for the most part for redeeming debt" but also help finance
environmental protection, public transport and research and
development projects.
    "Thanks to the favourable liquidity situation, debt will be
able to be repaid," the ministry said. "That will reduce the net
interest burden to 2.2 pct of net income, the lowest point
since 1974."
    Finance Minister Otto Strich said the government plans to
continue its tight fiscal policy as it moves toward its goal of
reducing taxes. In the meantime, it will concentrate on
redeeming its debt, he said in a statement.
    "In that way the interest payment burden on state finances
can be reduced and the government's ability to set policy
broadened," he said.

		<field name = "content">Avon Products Inc, which earlier
reported lower third quarter profits, said its fourth quarter
and full year earnings will exceed the year ago results due to
strong sales in its domestic cosmetics business and an improved
economic situtation in Brazil.
    Last year Avon earned 158.7 mln dlrs or 2.23 dlrs a share
on sales of 2.9 billion dlrs.
    In the current third quarter Avon said its earnings dropped
12 pct to 37 cts a share because of a wage and price freeze in
Brazil, one of the company's four major operating areas.
   
    "Themance of the domestic beauty business in
the fourth quarter should more than offset the impact of Brazil
on earnings," said Hicks Waldron, Avon's chairman and chief
executive, in a statement.
    John Cox, Avon's spokesman, told Reuters that Brazil's
economic problems costs the company 10 cts a share or about
seven mln dlrs in profits in the third quarter. He said that
about half of that loss was offset by the strong performance of
the company's domestic cosmetics business.
    For the nine month period, Avon's earnings were flat.
   
    Avon also said in a statement that an initial public
offering in Japan for up to 40 pct of its Japanese subsidiary,
which is expected to exceed 200 mln dlrs, may not take place as
scheduled in November.
    Avon said the offering will depend on world stock market
conditions.

    Officials in Hong Kong, worried that the notoriously
volatile market would go wild, suspended trading until next
Monday. Markets in Taiwan and South Korea, sheltered from
swings on the world's big bourses, were battered this time.
    Taipei's weighted index fell almost by its full permitted
level, shedding 172.9 points to close at 3,492.9.
    Seoul's composite index lost over 11 points by late morning
to 505.28, with investors worried about a possible rise in oil
prices after U.S. Attacks on Iranian oil platforms in the Gulf.
    "When the U.S. Catches cold, Taiwan sneezes," said general
manager Blair Pickerell of Jardine Fleming Taiwan Limited. "In
this case, Taiwan has got pneumonia."
    Blue chips in Singapore were hit by selling. The Straits

    "God willing, we will carry out our duty in the coming days
and make them sorry," said Rafsanjani in a speech to Parliament
later broadcast by Tehran Radio.
    The Tehran leadership have been quick to threaten vengeance
after the U.S. Raids on the rigs, one of which was destroyed.
    President Ali Khamenei, Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi
and now Rafsanjani within 24 hours of the U.S. Action have all
vowed retaliation.
    Rafsanjani, the parliamentary speaker, said, "It is not a
threat or an attempt at intimidation when we say we will
respond to aggression -- it is a reality and we have proved it
in practice." He added that the American attack "squares neither
with its superpower image nor its claim of concern with
security, nor reason and wisdom."
    U.S. Warships shelled an Iranian offshore oil platform and
American special forces boarded another, destroying equipment.
    The U.S. Government said the attack was a measured response
to an Iranian missile attack on the American-flagged Kuwaiti
tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters last Friday.

		<field name = "content">U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng said he is pleased the European Community plans to offer a
global farm reform plan at GATT later this month, although the
United States opposes key parts of the proposal.
    "We're pleased that they have moved in tabling a proposal.
It will help us in getting the negotiations underway," Lyng
told Reuters in an interview Tuesday.
    Lyng's comment came after EC ministers in Luxembourg
endorsed a farm reform package drafted by the EC Commission.
The EC plan will be presented at the next meeting of Uruguay
round agriculture negotiators in Geneva on October 26.
    Lyng said the United States would oppose parts of the plan
seeking a market sharing agreement for grains, and proposing
curbs on U.S. soybean and cereal substitute exports to Europe.
    The U.S. in July proposed to GATT the elimination of all
farm subsidies affecting trade within ten years, and has
pressed the EC to make a counter-offer with the aim of reaching
a global farm subsidy agreement by the end of 1988.
    However, the EC and some U.S. domestic groups have said the
Reagan administration plan to end all farm trade subsidies is
unrealistic.
    Asked about such criticism, Lyng said "The alternative to
doing that is to say that we preserve them and maintain them. I
think that is the unrealistic position."
    "I would suggest that they (EC) listen to what we are
trying to say."
    Lyng also rejected suggestions the U.S. and EC agree a
freeze in export subsidies to get the GATT negotiations 
started.
    "All that some countries would like to have would be a
wheat agreement where we would stop export subsidies on wheat.
That doesn't do a thing for us," Lyng said.
    The United States wants an end to subsidies in a range of
agricultural products from dairy products to vegetable oils, he
said.
    At the GATT negotiators meeting next week Canada is
expected to offer a proposal as well as the EC.
    The United States will be represented at the meeting by
former agriculture undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, recently
appointed special U.S. negotiator on agriculture.

    The company cited a one-time write-off of its investment in
the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp secondary

volume, and the effect of rising short-term rates on margins as
reasons for the expected decline.
    In addition, the company cited a net-after tax loss of 2.4
mln dlrs from its leasing operation during the 1987 nine mth
period as a reason for the anticipated earnings drop.
    Earlier today, the financial services company reported
earnings of 57.8 mln dlrs for the third quarter of 1987

		<field name = "titulo">TOYOTA TOYO.T> SEES LOWER U.S. SALES IN 1988</field>
		<field name = "content">Toyota Motor Co expects its U.S. vehicle
sales in 1988 will decline to about 875,000 cars and trucks
from roughly 930,000 expected in 1987, a senior exeuctive said.
    Jim Perkins, group vice president for sales and marketing
for Toyota's U.S. sales subsidiary, told reporters Toyota's
expected decline will come principally in the truck segment
where the company faces intense competition from U.S. domestic
manufacturers such as Ford Motor Co F>.
    Toyota, he said, also expects to stress sales in the low
and middle segments of the car market to remain competitive.
    Asked if Toyota's U.S. profits could show a substantial
decline with its lower trucks sales in the next two years, he
responded "conceivably it could," but added, "Our plan is not
to chase this thing to where it makes no economic sense."
    Perkins also predicted that the 1988 U.S. vehicle market
could fall below 15 mln sales from above 15 mln expected this
year. He expects some smaller Japanese automakers could be
forced to withdraw from the U.S. market or to seek partnerships
with one another in the face of intense competition.
     The Toyota executive said the collapse of U.S. stock
prices and any further weakening of the dollar would likely
have "a very quick impact on the Japanese (car) companies."
    "In our company, when the stock market goes down, we see it
very soon in the New York metropolitan car market. New York is
the best indicator of what's going to happen in the rest of of
the country. I can tell you from the next 15 days (of car
sales) in the New York market what it will be in the rest of
the country in the next six months," Perkins said.
     The Toyota executive said the panic selloff in the New
York Stock Exchange hurts the car market because "it does
create a shock wave of doubt in the minds of consumers."
     He said Toyota would wait at least 30 to 60 days to assess
the impact of the the stock market drop on the wider economy
before making any changes in its basic business plan for the
U.S. market.
    Toyota, he said, expects its 1988 U.S. sales will total at
least 600,000 cars and 275,000 trucks compared with about
630,000 cars and 300,000 trucks expected for 1987, and 644,000
cars and 388,000 trucks sold in 1986.
    He said Toyota hopes it will be able to import 610,000 cars
from Japan in 1988, the same as its 1987 allocation under
Tokyo's voluntary export restraint scheme.
    But he said it was uncertain if Toyota would keep its
current allocation becuase of pressures on Japan's Ministry of
International Trade and Industry to roll back Japanese car
export quotas from the current 2.3 mln annualized rate.

		<field name = "content">The Brazilian Coffee Institute
(IBC) has given shippers until close of business on Thursday to
submit details of past export performance in order that
individual quotas can be allocated, an IBC spokesman said.
    He told Reuters IBC President Jorio Dauster has confirmed
acceptance of National Coffee Policy Council (CNPC) proposals
to establish individual export quotas based 65 pct on export
performance, 25 pct on stocks and 10 pct by auction.
    Shippers can choose their best period of 12 consecutive
months between April 1, 1985, and September 30, 1987, to be
used for calculating the export performace portion.
    The IBC will total all the figures, calculate each shippers
participation and use this as a basis for allocation of
individual quotas, the IBC spokesman said.
    He said the IBC has already settled with the Sao Paulo
Mercantile Exchange how the auction system will operate.
Shippers can bid a premium over the contribution quota payable
on coffee exports and the succesful bidder will add this
premium to the contribution quota when he submits his export
sales declaration form.
    Auctions will not start until after the opening of export
registrations. The spokesman could not say when this might be
but trade sources said an announcement could come at the end of
the week, opening registraions from Monday.
    A meeting has been set for tomorrow in Brasilia of the
CNPC's export marketing committee to establish a system for
allocating the 25 pct of export quotas based on stock levels,
the spokesman added.
    A system of individual export quotas is being reestablished
in Brazil - a previous system was abandoned in 1985 - to ensure
shipments are kept in line with the country's ICO quota.

		<field name = "content">The European Community's farmers'
pressure group Copa has urged EC farm ministers to agree a tax
on vegetable proteins similar to the oils and marine fats tax
which has already been proposed by the EC Commission.
    Copa president Hans Kjeldsen told a news conference on
Tuesday he had also urged ministers to seek a similar mechanism
for cereal substitutes.
    He was speaking after a meeting of farm leaders with the
Danish foreign and agriculture ministers, who currently chair
meetings of their EC colleagues.
    Kjeldsen said taxes on the products concerned would help
the EC's budget problems and would provide some price stability
for producers.
    This would in turn help the market position for certain
crops of which the EC is a net importer such as oilseeds, peas
and beans, but for which the Commission is now proposing severe
output restrictions.
    A minority of EC ministers opposed to an oils and fats tax
on imported and domestically produced oils and marine fats
succeeded in blocking the idea during this year's annual EC
price fixing.
    However, the EC Commission has said it maintains its
proposals for a tax.
    Kjeldsen said Copa had urged the ministers to pursue
international negotiations on farm trade with the aim of
bridging the gap between EC and world prices.

		<field name = "content">Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs said he
sold the stake he held in Gillette Co GS> after deciding that
he could not force Gillette to accept a 47 dlr a share takeover
bid made by Revlon Group Inc REV>.
    Revlon's bid expired last week after being repeatedly
rejected by Gillette. Jacobs had earlier considered waging a
proxy fight over Gillette.
    Jacobs told Reuters he sold the Gillette stake, which he
called "substantial" but under five pct, a few weeks ago over a
period of several days. He said he sold the stock at a profit,
but did not disclose the selling price.
    Gillette's stock was at 24-1/8, up 1/8, in morning trade,
off the high of 45-7/8 reached after Revlon announced its bid.
    Jacobs said he sold his Gillette stake based on an
"investment decision. I surely did not see this happening," he
said of Monday's stock market free-fall.
    A Gillette spokesman said the mpany had no comment.
    Jacobs said he and fellow investor Carl Pohlad continue to
hold a stake in Allegheny International Inc AG>. In August
they disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing
that they had acquired 854,900 shares, or 7.9 pct, of Allegheny
and would consideer seeking control of the company.

		<field name = "content">Donald Regan, President Reagan's
former chief of staff, said the government should loosen the
money supply, try to keep interest rates down and try to reduce
the federal budget and trade deficits to avoid a recession.
    "I think what we have to face now is trying to preserve our
economy," the one-time chairman of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc
MER> said in an interview on the ABC television network.
    "We've got to loosen money, we've got to keep interest rates
down. We can't afford to let them go up. That means we're going
to have to work on our twin deficits, both the budget deficit
and the trade deficit," Regan said.
     "I certainly wouldn't tighten money at this particular
moment," Regan said when asked about the prospects for a
recession following Monday's price drop on Wall Street.
    "I think that if they were to do that, they'd create the
same conditions that we did in '29...They choked off the money
supply and what happened? We went into a major recession. I
think that's the one thing we've got to avoid right now."
    Regan also called on the government to impose restrictions
on program trading. "I think that that's exacerbated,
exaggerated this decline, and I think it's something that they
must stop," he said.

and the union representing its 40,000 workers remain far apart
over local issues in contract talks two days from a threatened
strike, a union spokesman said.
    The deepest divisions appeared to be between General Motors
of Canada Ltd and the Canadian Auto Workers local representing
17,000 workers at an assembly plant in Oshawa, Ontario, union
spokesman Wendy Cuthbertson said.
    "Local 222 is miles apart," said Cuthbertson. The local
assembles full-size pick-up trucks, the Buick Regal and the
Pontiac 6000.
    Local issues there included shift schedules, transfers and
working conditions, union president Bob White said.
    The union has threatened to strike at 1000 hrs EDT (1400
gmt) on Thursday unless it has reached a tentative settlement
with the automaker by then.
    Bargaining was scheduled to continue late into the night
Tuesday in an effort to avert a walkout, said Cuthbertson.
    On Monday, the union accepted an economic offer from GM
Canada that largely matched the pay-and-benefit pattern reached
earlier at Chrysler and Ford in Canada.

    But the bank was insured against such an event and the loss
would not affect its results, said head of the bank's treasury

    Seidman also said that he was pleased at the decision by

behavior. "I think it's a good idea," he said.
    Seidman said he believes the economy will remain strong as
long as interest rates remain stable.
    He said the Federal Reserve Board's announcement that it
stood ready to provide liquidity to the financial system was an
effort to reassure markets.
    "In 1929, they did not provide it (liquidity) and now they
are reassuring people that that will not happen again. I fully
support it," he said.
    He said that the stock market decline was not an argument
against allowing banks to underwrite securities because the
stock market is expected to fluctuate.

		<field name = "content">Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
said the ruling of a GATT panel on a U.S. trade complaint
against Japan, expected soon, may influence the U.S. stance in
negotiations with Tokyo on beef and citrus import quotas.
    The ruling of a GATT tribunal on a U.S. demand that Japan
end quotas on 12 categories of food items is expected by the
end of the year. Lyng said he is optimistic the ruling will
favor the U.S.
    "These are quota items, and the principles that apply to
them, it seems to me, will have some bearing on the question of
whether you would have quotas or not on beef and citrus," Lyng
told Reuters in an interview.
    He repeated the U.S. demand that Japan lift the quotas on
beef and citrus after March 31, next year.
    The Japanese quotas on 12 food categories which the United
States has challenged include items such as tomato paste, some
cheeses and specialty fruit juices.
    U.S. officials had hoped a ruling against the quotas would
be issued earlier this year but the GATT panel decision has
been delayed by the illness of the tribunal's chairman.
    The U.S. has taken a hardline stance on the beef and citrus
quotas, which Tokyo says must remain in place to protect
Japanese farmers.
    "We will not negotiate new quotas or accept new quotas (on
beef and citrus). If they impose them we would consider that an
illegal action in the GATT, Lyng said.
    He declined to say what action the U.S. would take next
April if Japan continues to resist U.S. demands.

		<field name = "content">Monday's international
share crash was exaggerated and did not reflect economic
fundamentals, Wolfgang Roeller, president of the West German
banking association BDB said in a statement.
    "A comparison with the (Wall Street crash of) 1929 is
totally inappropriate," Roeller, also chief executive of
Dresdner Bank AG, said.
    The world economy was growing and dangers of inflation were
being held in check. The recent International Monetary Fund and
World meetings confirmed the positive forecasts for global
economic development.
    Therefore, there were no rational reasons for a sharp
tightening of monetary policy nor for a continued rise in
interest rates, Roeller said.
    "This applies in particular to West Germany," he said.
    As a result, Roeller expected the markets to calm. They
would not ignore long-term economic factors.
    International cooperation on currencies established by the
Louvre accord and strengthened by Monday's meeting between U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker, West German Finance Minister
Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl,
would stand the test, he added.

    The Court of Appeal hearings include action between brokers

		<field name = "content">The American Soybean Association (ASA)
denounced European Community (EC) oilseed policies as illegal
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and
threatened to make an unfair trade complaint if the EC does not
remedy the situation.
    ASA Vice President James Adams told an ASA-sponsored
Outlook 87 conference: "It will be filed unless the EC takes
drastic and immediate steps."
    "These subsidies are blatantly unfair and are GATT illegal,
since they were established after the zero soybean duty was
established in 1962," he said.
    The ASA's unfair trade petition against the EC would ask
for an investigation and modification of EC oilseed policies to
make the regime non-discriminatory.
    The EC in 1962 ruled all EC oilseed imports duty-free, in
an effort to fill its oilseed needs. But EC oilseeds production
has risen dramatically since then.
    The EC now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above world
market levels and is considering implementing a controversial
oils and fats tax.
    The subsidies "are obvious attempts to circumvent the zero
duty binding and that makes U.S. Farmers mad as hell," Adams
said.
    The ASA is confident the U.S. Congress will support its
trade complaint, Adams said. The ASA also strongly opposes an
EC proposal to tax vegetable and marine oils consumed in the
EC, which will be considered by the EC Commission in December.
    U.S. Soybean world market share has declined 35 pct in
volume and 40 pct in value since 1982, primarily as a result of
EC policies, Adams added.
    Lord Plumb, European Parliament President and a speaker at
the conference, said the EC expanded oilseed production in 1973
when the U.S. Halted overseas sales of soy products.

		<field name = "AUTHOR">By Lisa Vaughan</field>
		<field name = "content">The United States is prepared to "pull out
all the stops" to defend its agricultural trade rights under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), U.S. Ambassador
to GATT Michael Samuels said.
    Those rights are now being challenged by the European
Community's (EC) agricultural support policies, he told a
conference sponsored by the American Soybean Association.
    He reiterated Washington's firm intention to retaliate if
the EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef without
the issue being investigated by a GATT special committee.
    The U.S. claims the EC directive, due to come into effect
on January 1, threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of U.S. meat
shipments into the EC.
    The U.S. also will oppose all EC efforts to impair U.S.
trade via the EC oilseeds regime, which supports EC oilseed
prices over the current market level and which may be extended
to include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax, Samuels said.
    Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies,
an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral trade
negotiations, "is meaningless if import barriers continue to be
erected," Samuels said.
    Samuels called the U.S. plan to eliminate world farm
subsidies by the year 2000, proposed at GATT in July, "visionary"
and "very serious."  The EC and Japan have said it is
unrealistic.
    The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposal
on farm trade reform, expected to be tabled at GATT formally
next week.
    The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reduce
tensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cereals
substitutes, dairy and sugar. It also calls for reduction of
farm subsidies.
    The U.S. Is not opposed to short-term measures, as long as
they are directly linked to long-term commitments to end major
trade distortions, Samuels said.
    Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formally
submitted and respond to it officially then.
    "We will consider its relation to the Punta del Este
declaration to correct trade problems and expand market access,"
the U.S. Ambassador said.
    The U.S. can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignores
the U.S. plan when it tables its own proposal, he added.
    The key difference between the two approaches is that the
U.S. wants farm subsidies eliminated, while the EC is pushing
only for a reduction in farm suppports, Samuels said.
    If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze,
there would be little incentive for the Community to work to
correct the international trade situation, he added.
    Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint, the EC
oilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports to
third countries as three crucial barriers to trade which the
U.S. wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT.

that it was ready to retaliate for any further hostile military
action in the Gulf as U.S. warships began escorting another
tanker convoy southward from Kuwait.
    U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said the U.S.
sought no further Gulf hostitilies but was ready to deal with
any Iranian response to Monday's attack on an Iranian oil rig.
    Several hours later, the Pentagon announced that U.S.
warships had begun escorting two U.S. flag Kuwaiti tankers --
the 80,000 ton product carrier Ocean City and 46,000 ton
liquified petroleum tanker Gas King -- southward from Kuwait.
    The Defense Department said the 12th such convoy of U.S.
flagged Kuwaiti tankers through the Gulf began at 0230 EDT
under the escort by the U.S. guided missile frigate Ford. It
did not say what oth U.S. warships were in the area.
    "It (the convoy) is now progressing uneventfully in the
central Gulf," the Pentagon statement said.
    Asked on NBC's "Today" program if the United States was
prepared for a major war with Iran, Weinberger said, "Well we
are prepared I think for whatever eventualities emerge from
this situation but we don't look on it as a war."

		<field name = "content">U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng said the United States will continue its policy of
subsidizing farm exports to regain lost markets until there is
a global agreement to end such subsidies.
    In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also acknowledged he was
troubled by the prospect that the export enhancement program
(EEP) could prove so indispensable to boosting U.S. exports
that the U.S. would have difficulty abandoning it.
    "Yes, I'm troubled with that a little bit," he said. "There's
no question about it, the longer you feed the calf on the cow,
the longer it is to wean it."
    In recent months, USDA has offered subsidies on a growing
list of commodities to an increasing number of countries.
    Lyng called U.S. and European Community export subsidies
"just plain nonsensical as a long-term policy" and said he saw an
end to the expansion of the EEP.
    "I'm sure there's an end to the expansion, but we are doing
this to accomplish our goal which is to regain the markets that
we've lost, to keep our products competitive and to let those,
particularly the European Community, who, we are convinced, are
the worst offenders in terms of the export subsidization, that
we are prepared to continue to do this until we can come to
some agreement to put an end to it," he said.

		<field name = "content">The Soviet oil production target for 1988
has been set at 625 mln tonnes, a rise of eight mln tonnes over
this year's planned output.
    Oil Minister Vasily Dinkov announced the figure on Tuesday
at the Supreme Soviet, the country's nominal parliament.
    He said a new development strategy, fuller use of oil
deposits and better housing and pay for oilmen had allowed an
upsurge in the oil industry after three years of stagnation
which began in late 1983.
    Last year the Soviet Union produced 615 mln tonnes of oil,
slightly short of the target of 616.7 mln.
    January-September figures released at the weekend showed
Soviet oil output in the first nine months of this year at 467
mln tonnes. The 1987 target is 617 million.
    Dinkov said the Soviet Union would develop 38 new oil
deposits in the coming year. He called for speedier geolog
prospecting across the country to spur the oil industry.
    The Supreme Soviet convened on Monday to endorse the 1988
budget and plan. The session is expected to end on Tuesday.

a result of its decision in the second quarter to curtail sales
of loans and mortgage-backed securities.
    As a result, after-tax gains on sales of loans and
mortgage-backed securities accounted for 28 pct of its third
quarter net, compared to 82 pct in last year's third quarter.
    The company reported third quarter income of 40.3 mln dlrs,
or 41 cts per share, down from 78.9 mln dlrs, or 80 cts per
share, a year ago.
   
    The company said third qurter loan sales totaled 366 mln
dlrs, inlcuding 290 mln dlrs of adjustable rate mortgage
instruments, generating after-tax gains of 11.2 mln dlrs. This
compares with year ago loan sales of 2.29 billion dlrs,
generating after-tax gains of 65.1 mln dlrs.
    Third quarter loan originations totaled a record 3.48
billion dlrs, up 29 pct frrm 2.69 billion dlrs a year ago,
reflecting record loan fundings and the reduced loan sales.
    Ahmanson said monthly adjustable rate loans accounted for
85.8 pct of the real estate loans and mortgage-backed
securities, up from 77.6 pct a year ago.

		<field name = "AUTHOR">By Felix Dearden</field>
		<field name = "content">The United States appears to have won a
transatlantic battle by forcing the Bundesbank to trim interest
rates, European economists said.
    But they added Washington set the stakes high by testing
the limits of the Louvre accord while global stock markets were
plunging.
    West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker reaffirmed their commitment to
currency stability at a secret meeting yesterday in Frankfurt,
according to official statements released late Monday.
    Only 13 hours after the statements were released, the
Bundesbank reduced short-term interest rates by offering banks
liquidity at a fixed bid rate of 3.80 pct, down from a 3.85 pct
facility rate offered last week.
    While the two ministers were meeting with Bundesbank
president Karl Otto Poehl, the central bank had also added
money market liquidity repeatedly, signalling it did not want a
strong rise in the tender allocation rate on Tuesday.
     "It's round one to the Americans, " said Richard Reid,
senior European economist for brokers UBS/Philips and Drew in
London.
    But Reid added, "We shouldn't forget that it has taken one
of the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the West
Germans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 0.05
percentage point."
    Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of earlier tightening
of West German monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall and
fuelled speculation that the Louvre accord was no longer valid.
    Six leading industrial nations agreed under February's
Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetary
policies. It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven -
the US, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
    The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency markets
and the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours trading
in New York. At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday, the dollar was
quoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on Monday.
    Guenther Aschoff, chief economist at Deutsche
Genossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on world
stock markets had been the main reason for the fall in West
German short-term interest rates on Tuesday.
    "The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock market
losses... That was the responsible thing to do and if it fits
with Baker's wishes, then all the better," he said.
    No central bank wants to let interest rates rise, and the
Bundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following rises
in the U.S., Aschoff said.
    Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the central
bank has no interest in higher capital market rates and he
thought the global rate increase was a cause for concern.
    Giles Keating, economist with Credit Suisse First Boston
Ltd in London said "The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreat
and Baker has won a battle...But he hasn't won the war as the
security repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it was
before the IMF meeting last month in Washington."
    Before the IMF meeting, when the Louvre Accord was
reaffirmed, the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidity
at 3.60 pct, Keating noted.
    Economists said the United States now appeared to have
agreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and support
the dollar in return for the German action on interest rates.
    Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinder
Washington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit, Stoltenberg
told a news conference on Tuesday. He added he would not rule
out central banks of leading industrial countries intervening
on exchange markets to defend the dollar's value.
    Deutsche Genossenschaftbank's Aschoff stressed West
Germany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currency
stability. In addition, both the U.S. And West German central
banks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force them
to again spend vast sums intervening to support the dollar.

    In an effort to reduce the volatility in the market today,
the NYSE temporarily suspended trading on the New York Futures

    The NYSE said the reason for the suspension was that they

		<field name = "content">Texaco Inc chairman Alfred DeCrane said
the company anticipates that the Texas State Supreme Court will
agree to hear its 10.3 billion dlr legal battle with Pennzoil
Co PZL> over ownership of Getty Oil.
    "We expect that the Texas Supreme Court will hear our case,
will heed the voices of impartial third parties and will
ultimately reverse this unjust decision and thus provide the
simple basic justice that Texaco has asked for all along,"
DeCrane said in a speech at a meeting of the International
Association of Drilling Contractors.
    DeCrane said he expected the Texas State Supreme Court to
overturn a State Appeals Court ruling that found Texaco
unlawfully interfered with Pennzoil's 1984 plan to acquire
Getty Oil.
    "This case has become much more than a quarrel between two
companies," DeCrane said. "It presents a far broader threat to
our economic system and to justice in America as we know it
today."
   
    Settlement talks between the two oil companies to resolve
the billion dlr lawsuit reportedly stalled earlier this year
when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a friend
of the court brief in support of Texaco.
    The agency claimed Pennzoil violated SEC rule 10B-13 which
prohibits the purchase of shares privately at the same time a
tender offer is outstanding.
    DeCrane also said concerns expressed by 19 state attorneys
general in the legal proceedings also favored Texaco's
position.
    "The bottom line is that the SEC had intervened to insure
that its rule are interpreted properly in the interest of
millions of private stockholders around the country who might
some day find themselves the victim of this same kind of
manipulation," DeCrane told the oilmen.
    He warned that if the state appeals court judgment was
upheld in Pennzoil's favor, it would "send out of state
businesses fleeing from Texas in droves."
    Texaco filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
bankruptcy code last April after a state appeals court upheld
Pennzoil's 10.3 billion dlr judgment.
   
    Texaco's appeal of the decision to the Texas State Supreme
Court has been pending for several weeks and the court is
expected to decide soon whether it will agree to review the
lower court ruling.
    If the Texas State Supreme Court does not hear the case,
Texaco has said it will take its case to the U.S. Supreme
Court.

following the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group, EC
officials said.
    Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers, Argentina
will gain additional trading rights on a series of products
including meat, fish and cereals by-products.
    But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with
Canada and Japan and are due to study these again, the

    The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC
states after West Germany withdrew objections to increased
quotas for Argentina on high-quality beef.
    Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat,
saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals
substitutes, but they were outvoted by the other states, the
officials said. Under the deal, Argentina will benefit from
improved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular the
quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500
tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will
be increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes.
    Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of
5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced
levies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said.
    The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said
that Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected their
exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. They
have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade).
    But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve
Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had
been affected by the country's EC membership.
    Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the
fish dispute with Canada.
    Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan. The EC
claims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group has
improved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied
with Japanese offers of compensation.
    Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems on
citrus fruits to aid EC exports, to improve tariffs for some
other farm produce, to increase tariffs for leather footwear
and to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal.
    EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq told
journalists: "We maintain our position that the (Japanese)
concessions were not enough."
    "We hope that there will be an improvement," he said.

Norway's biggest commercial bank, said it boosted its profits
in 1987's first eight months by 32.3 pct after vigorously
cutting loan losses and operating costs.
    The bank showed a 300 mln crown net profit after provisions
for losses and taxes in the period ending on August 31, against
a 203 mln crown profit in the same year-ago period, it said.
    DNC's biggest gains were seen in the domestic market, but
some of its foreign exchange and securities units have been hit
by sharply higher interest rates for the dollar and results
remained unsatisfactory, it added.
    Total assets rose to 132 billion crowns from 107.6 billion.
    Although the group's operating profit dropped to 875 mln
crowns compared with 986 mln a year-ago, the loss was countered
by reducing the need to set aside capital to cover loan losses,
it added.
    "In 1986 DNC made substantial provisions for potential loan
losses, particularly in the oil and shipping sectors...The need
for write-offs in these sectors has now been substantially
reduced," the bank said.
    DNC, with extensive exposure in the oil industry, was hard
hit by plunging crude prices last year.

		<field name = "content">Manufacturers Hanover Corp said it
earned 129.1 mln dlrs for the third quarter, up from 105.8 mln
a year earlier.
    Net income per common share rose to 2.73 dlrs from 2.29
dlrs.
    Manufacturers Hanover said it raised common shareholders'
equity at the end of the third quarter from the second quarter
by 347 mln dlrs, to 2.09 billion dlrs. Included in the increase
was 267 mln dlrs from the sale last month of 6.9 mln new shares
of the corporation's common stock, and 76 mln dlrs from
retained earnings.
   
    Primary capital grew to 6.2 billion dlrs, or 7.92 pct of
total assets, up from 5.3 billion dlrs, or 7.07 pct, a year
earlier.
    Provisions for possible loans losses in the third quarter
was 111.9 mln dlrs, down from 139.5 mln a year ago. The reserve
for loan losses stood at 4.78 pct of total loans at the end of
September, up from 1.72 pct a year earlier.
    "We have placed top priority on the restoration of
shareholders' equity in the shortest time frame possible," said
John McGillicuddy, chairman and chief executive.
    "The first step was selling the full amount of new common
equity we anticipate needing in this replenishment process,"
McGillicuddy added. "The remainder will come from higher core
earnings, the sale of undervalued, non-strategic assets and the
recognition of tax benefits."
    Taken together, he said, these moves, as well as tighter
control over asset levels, will raise the corporation's common
equity-to-assets ratio to the four-pct range by the end of
1988. The ratio was 2.77 pct on September 30.
    For the nine months, Manufacturers reported a net loss of
1.16 billion dlrs, down from a gain of 301.8 mln a year ago.
    On a per-share basis, the loss was 28.33 dlrs, down from a
gain of 6.42 dlrs.
    The nine-month results reflect the impact of a previously
announced decision last quarter to boost the corporation's
loan-loss reserves by 1.7 billion dlrs. Without the addition,
net income would have been 263.3 mln dlrs, or 5.41 a share.
    Net interest revenue on a taxable equivalent basis in the
third quarter was 494.2 mln dlrs, down from 546.4 mln.
    Non-interest expenses in the latest quarter rose to 571.0
mln dlrs from 541.8 mln. Total capital at September 30 rose to

		<field name = "AUTHOR">By Peter Kiernan</field>
		<field name = "content">Many Florida investors are old enough to
have seen it all before -- they lived through the Crash of '29
and Monday's stock market debacle was just another day for
some.
    "I don't sell," declared one elderly investor, who said he
had more than one mln dlrs in stocks. "Whatever goes down is
bound to come back up."
    The uniqueness of south Florida investors was easy to see
in brokerage offices around Miami, where the average age of the
crowds watching the Big Board quotations flash by on Tuesday
was retirement and beyond.
   
    "I don't know of any demographic studies, but we certainly
have the highest number of elderly active investors," said
Marshall Moore, a vice president of AmeriFirst Securities
Corporation in Miami.
    He worries that Monday's record loss of more than 500
points on the New York Stock Exchange will scare many people,
particularly those on fixed incomes, out of the market forever.
    "They will not be in stocks any longer," he said. "When you
start getting heart palpitations and sweaty palms you have to
get out and stay out except for maybe utilities and some
income-oriented issues."
   
    Across the state on the Gulf coast where there are heavy
concentrations of retired persons, Robert Lee of Investment
Management and Research Incorporated said there were "a lot of
serious losses out there."
    Retirees account for 90 per cent of his firm's business and
could take comfort in the fact that its professional managers
took their money out of the market last month. "But for those
who were buying in on the recent  upswing, this is devastating,"
he said.
   
    Miami Beach broker George Fox, most of whose clients are
over 60, worries that many are not taking the situation
seriously enough. Those who depend on their market earnings
should be a lot more concerned, he said. "I am scared because I
think this could become very serious."
    One 93-year-old investor said the market was bound to fall
sharply, "I just didn't think it would happen so soon." She
remembered '29 and said she remained stingy to this day as a
result. "I still find it hard to spend money."

		<field name = "content">Ford Motor Co Chairman Donald Petersen
still expects slightly more than 15 mln U.S.-made cars and
trucks will be sold domestically in 1987, he told reporters.
    This is down from the 16.1 mln U.S. built vehicles sold
domestically last year, he added.
    Despite the sell-off in world stock markets, Petersen said,
the underlying fundamentals in the private sector of the U.S.
economy remain strong so calendar 1988 vehicle sales should
equal the 1987 total.
   
    Petersen said he could not explain nor predict stock market
activity.
    But he called for government officials to seriously address
long-term problems such as the trade and budget deficits,
stating the dollar is still too strong relative to other major
currencies.
    For example, he said, the dollar should be about 120 yen
currently instead of its present level just below 144 yen.
   
    Petersen said Ford plans to spend substantially more in the
next five years than the 15.9 billion dlrs spent in the last
five on new products and upgrading of its manufacturing
operations.
    In 1986, Ford spent 3.4 billion dlrs to upgrade vehicle
manufacturing plants, he noted.
    He also said growth in free world car and truck sales will
be 1.8 pct per year over the next 10 years.
    Worldwide over-capacity, which was about 2.7 mln units in
1985, could expand to nine mln units by 1990, with more than
five mln of those units in North America, Petersen said.

and was necessary for the financial well-being and
efficiency of the operation.
    The company said the existing casino portion of the Resorts
Casino would be converted to a convention and exhibition space.
    The company said the petition also requests the approval of
a comprehensive services agreement between Resorts and Trump
Hotel Corp>, which is controlled by Donald J. Trump.
    Under the agreement, Trump Hotel agrees to provide a
comprehensive range of services including marketing,
management, and construction and development to Resorts, the
company said.
    The company said the agreement also provides for the
non-exclusive license to Resorts to use the Trump name and
other trademarkes and service marks in connection with the
operations and marketing of Resorts properties.
    The terms of the agreement call for Trump Hotel to receive
an annual services fee of 1-3/4 pct of Resorts adjusted gross
revenue and 15 pct of its adjusted net income, the company
said. Additionally, Trump Hotel will receive a fee equal to
three pct of the post July 21, 1987 construction costs of the
Taj Mahal, the company said.
    The company said the proposed consolidation and the service
agreement were both unanimously approved by a committee of

		<field name = "content">Texaco Inc chairman Alfred DeCrane said
the massive stock market correction could affect any out of
court settlement of the company's 10.3 billion dlr legal
dispute with Pennzoil Co PZL>.
    However, DeCrane refused to say whether the two companies
were holding any settlement negotiations.
    "Certainly the market shakeout might affect the way this is
handled," DeCrane told reporters following a speech at a
meeting of the International Association of Drilling
Contractors.
    "In this environment, cash looks very important."
    DeCrane declined to say whether Texaco and Pennzoil had
held any recent settlement talks, citing a confidentiality
agreement between the two companies.
    "A few months ago Texaco offered 100 mln dlrs cash, no
strings attached just to take this appeal to the Texas Supreme
Court," DeCrane said. He was referring to a non-settlement
proposal that would have eliminated the threat of Pennzoil
filing liens, or ownership rights, against Texaco property
before the company filed for bankruptcy protection in April.
    "I think that (the offer) looks pretty good now to a
Pennzoil shareholder whose stock is trading around 30 or 40."
    Settlement talks between the two companies reportedly broke
down earlier this year after Pennzoil insisted it would not
settle for less than four billion dlrs.
    Since then, Texaco has asked the Texas State Supreme Court
to review the 10.3 billion dlr judgment against it.
    DeCrane also said it was not clear if the stock market drop
could spur further consolidation in the oil patch.
    "We know the value is there. The market fluctuation has not
changed the value of the underlying assets," DeCrane said
of publicly traded U.S. oil companies.

		<field name = "titulo">U.S. SAFETY NETS SHOULD BLOCK 1929-TYPE CRASH</field>
		<field name = "AUTHOR">By Michael Posner</field>
		<field name = "content">Cascading global stock prices are
evoking grim memories of the great market crash of 1929, but
analysts are reminding investors of safeguards in place before
they stash their savings under the mattress.
    But some also say that while banking, securities and social
laws written during the great depression should prevent a
repeat of that dismal era, more protection still might have to
be considered.
   
    And analysts caution that while new laws can deal with some
problems, lawmakers can't legislate away fear--which  helped
drive the New York Stock Exchange to its record 508-point Dow
Jones index loss on Monday.
    That 22.6 percent loss nearly doubled the Oct 29, 1929 
loss of 11.7 percent. On the day before that year, the market
fell nearly 13 per cent.
    In a series of Reuters interviews with government,
congressional and private analysts, most agreed safeguards
exist to avoid a repeat of 1929 and its depression aftermath.
    Charles Schultze, chairman of the president's Council of
Economic Advisers under Jimmy Carter, said in an interview that
"the safeguards should be adequate to avoid a repeat of 1929 to
1933."
    "The safeguards are fine," he said, "The safeguards are
adequate to prevent a cascading liquidity failure. That's not
the overall problem which is the dollar and trade deficits."
    Schultze, now with the Brookings Institution think-tank,
pointed to a weak Federal Reserve during the 1920s when "the Fed
acted in the wrong way in 1929--it tightened money."
   
    Similarly, President Reagan's budget manager, James Miller,
told Reuters the safeguards in place should be adequate.
    And millionaire oilman and business takeover specialist T.
Boone Pickens said the present safeguards should avoid any 1929
situation.
    "It is a much more sophisticated system, I don't see that a
comparison is valid."
    Marvin Kosters, director of economic policy studies at the
conservative American Enterprise Institute, thinks the present
safeguards will work.
   
    "The main thing is the understanding of the Federal Reserve
of its responsibility to maintain liquidity in the economy," he
said. "There is no reason why this (market fall) needs to spread
into the real economy. Maybe it's better it happened at all."
    Rex Hardesty of the huge labor confederation AFL-CIO said
many of the present safeguards are not working, saying "only
one-third of the unemployed are now receiving benefits."
    He also called for an increase in the 3.35 dlr minimum wage
which has not been raised since 1981.
    One of the main things that appears different in 1987 than
in 1929 is market psychology, analysts point out.
    During those anything goes days of flappers and bathtub
gin, the stock market was the road to riches that captured the
savings of shoeshine boys to bank presidents. It was viewed as
a highway to heaven with no turning back.
    But happy days soon collapsed into a nationwide, hysterical
panic with the stock market crash, wiping out paper millions
and losing the life savings of many average investors as panic
set in.
    Brokers leaped from Wall Street skyscrapers. American banks
closed for a  "holiday" in 1933 as depositors clamored to pull
out their savings. The great depression followed leading into
World War II.
    Images of those days surfaced with the unprecedented sell
off on Monday, but analysts maintained times are different.
    House Banking committee specialist Jake Lewis said that
bank investors should have no fears because their savings are
now completely backed by the government. 
    Even though there have been record bank failures --145 last
year, 148 this year through today--everyone received their
savings--unlike the millions lost when banks collapsed 60 years
ago.
     Banking deposits, then uninsured, now are fully insured by
the government up to 100,000 dlrs for each saver.
    As the depression swept the nation, President Franklin
Roosevelt steered into law sweeping banking and securities
reforms to deal with many of the problems that led to the crash
and hurt people afterwards.

was surprised by recent criticism of West German economic
policies voiced by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker but
added that the criticism was not purely one-sided.
    Stoltenberg told the West German Trade and Industry

States)." He added. "Criticism is not a one-way street."
    He did not elaborate, but Bonn has often called on the U.S.

policies, saying that rises in domestic interest rates here
were not in the spirit of last February's Louvre pact to
stabilise currencies.
    Stoltenberg told the DIHT that his meeting on Monday with
Baker had resolved differences between the two countries.
    At a news conference earlier on Tuesday Stoltenberg had
declined to comment specifically on Baker's criticisms, but he
had said that after three hours of discussions on Monday, "one

		<field name = "content">U.S. military planners ruled out
Iran's Silkworm missiles as a target in the retaliatory attack
mounted on Monday for fear of being drawn more deeply into the
Iran-Iraq war, defense and Middle East experts said.
    U.S. naval forces destroyed an offshore oil platform and
raided another in what the administration called a "measured and
appropriate response" to an Iranian Silkworm missile attack last
Friday on a U.S.-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti waters.
    Private analysts generally agreed that going after the rig
rather than an onshore economic or military target such as
Silkworm launch sites reflected a careful bid by Washington to
limit the political, military and diplomatic fallout both at
home and in the Gulf.
    "It simply demonstrated the United States will take military
action when they (Iran) take military action," Norman Polmar, a
defense analyst and author, said.
    He said hitting the platforms had spared Iran the
embarrassment of casualties on its own soil, possibly avoiding
an escalating spiral of attack and counterattack.
    In addition, it minimized the risk to U.S. forces and the
potential embarrassment of any losses, including aircraft that
could have been shot down had they taken part in an attack.
    Anthony Cordesman, author of a new book on the Iran-Iraq
war, said the United States apparently chose a limited target
to keep alive the possibility that U.N. Secretary General
Javier Perez de Cuellar might still persuade Iran to accept a
Security Council call for a ceasefire.
    "We want the U.N. peace initiative to work if there's any
chance at all," he said, adding that the action made it clear
tougher steps would follow if Iran to attack Gulf shipping.

   In targeting an oil rig -- albeit one said by the Pentagon
to have been turned into a military command post -- Washington
also sent a message that it might be willing to attack Iran's
economic lifeline. Pentagon officials said the platform had
been used as a base for Iranian raids against shipping in the
lower Gulf.
    "We have chosen a military target, but we also have shown
Iran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exporting
capabilities," Cordesman said.
    He predicted the United States would respond to any future
major Iranian challenges by hitting Iran's naval base at Bandar
Abbas on the Straits of Hormuz, followed by mining the
approaches to Iran's oil export terminal on Kharg Island.
    Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Monday the
United States did not seek further confrontation with Iran, "but
we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action
by Iran with stronger countermeasures."

    Lawson said the Bank of England also saw no reason to

    The Bank of England had earlier declined comment.
    Analysts said Greenspan's pledge that the Fed would stand

current turmoil should not spill over into the rest of the
economy through a crisis in a financial institution caught out
by heavy equity price losses and bond price volatility.

speaking at a meeting of EC farm ministers, called for action
to help the Spanish maize market, Spanish diplomatic sources
said.
    Spain is threatened with massive imports from third
countries by the end of the year, they said.
    They said the imports are due to come in as a result of the
accord by which the EC has promised the United States it will
import two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum
into Spain from third countries this year.
    Around a sixth of this tonnage has so far come in under a
reduced levy system and the EC cereals management committee may
decide this week to authorise the Spanish intervention board to
make direct purchases.
    The sources said Romero urged that other EC countries
should take some of the imports to prevent disturbance of the
Spanish market.
    They said he threatened to withhold support for the EC
Commission plan for new limits on farm output which if breached
would mean price cuts unless Spain received some help.
    The sources said no direct reply was given to Romero at the
meeting.

		<field name = "content">Telex Corp said its board adopted a
shareholder rights plan which will allow shareholders to
purchase one common share for two dlrs if a hostile group
acquires 15 pct or more of the company.
    However, the company said the plan will not be triggered by
purchases pursuant to the 65 dlrs a share tender offer
commenced on October 9 by a unit of TLX Partners, a group
controlled by New York financier Asher Edelman.
    It said the rights will be distributed on a one for one
basis to all shareholders as of October 30 and may be redeemed
before they become exercisable at five cents per right.
    The company said the rights will expire on the later of
February 17 next year or 60 days from the date they become
exercisable. It said the plan was intended to protect
stockholders against any attempt to take unfair advantage of
the recent decline in stock prices or to use abusive tactics
such as market accumulations which would interfere with its
ability to maximize stockholder value.
    The rights become exercisable if any person or group
acquires 15 pct or more of the company's common stock other
than through an all cash tender offer for all outstanding
shares at 65 dlrs per share.
     It said the rights will also not become exercisable if the
company is acquired by a group under an agreement made with its
board.
     A spokeswoman told Reuters the company would have an
official response to Edelman's bid by Friday, Oct 23.

cooperate with U.S. Aerospace group McDonnell Douglas Corp on
future aircraft programs, pointing the way to a defusion of the
transatlantic dispute on subsidies to the aircraft industry,
French Transport Ministry Jacques Douffiagues said.
    He told the southern French daily Depeche du Midi in an
interview today that the talks between senior U.S. And European
Community officials in London on October 27 on the Airbus
question should be more harmonious as a result.
  
    Airbus officials said last week that they were continuing
talks on possible collaboration with McDonnell Doughlas on
aircraft projects, including an eventual stretched version of
the Airbus A320 short-haul jet, but that collaboration in the
immediate future was unlikely.
    U.S. Manufacturers and officials have charged that the
French, British and West German governments have disrupted the
world aviation market by unfairly subsidising Airbus, allowing
it to undercut private U.S. Competitors, while the Europeans
have responded by saying that U.S. Manufacturers benefit from
large government-funded military contracts.
    Douffiagus said that transatlantic cooperation was already
widespread in aircraft construction.

		<field name = "titulo">AMERICAN EXPRESS SAYS ITS STRATEGY IS STABLE</field>
		<field name = "AUTHOR">By Alison Rea</field>
		<field name = "content">American Express Co's AXP> president
Louis Gerstner Jr. said a bear market will not effect his
company's long-term strategy.
    "I don't think where the market goes over any month long
period, two day period, or even six month period has anything
to do with our strategy," Gerstner told Reuters.
    "We have built a strategy for our company that looks out
over many years and anticipates a lot of change," he said.
    Gerstner said the company's long term strategy is to build
and maintain a major position in the financial and travel
service industries. American Express is the 69 pct parent of
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc SHE>.
    Gerstner would not comment on the share market tailspin.
    However, American Express chairman James Robinson said in a
statement that the company could endure the market turbulence
and was in a strong position for further growth.
    "All brokerage firms make money if the market goes down or
up," Gerstner told Reuters without elaborating.
    Gerstner said Shearson had no plans to quit its municipal
bond activities. "Shearson Lehman Brothers tends to adjust to
trends in incremental steps. You will see it doing less of the
convulsive one-time changes that people in this industry will
go through," he said. Shearson recently laid off 150 people in
London and is limiting hiring, but Gerstner said American
Express remains committed to the London market and to having a
global presence.
    "That Shearson let a couple of hundred people go in London
is not even an anthill on the landscape we're discussing. We
are discussing long-term strategy," Gerstner said.
    Earlier this year, American Express sold 13 pct of its
stake in Shearson to Nippon Life Insurance Co of Japan and a
further 18 pct to the public. Gerstner said these moves "had no
implications of an exit from financial services."
    "Our committment globally is represented by the Nippon
tie-up which dwarfs the fact we decided to reduce the size of
one department, in one company, in one of our subsidiaries," he
said.
    Many securities firms now are stressing merchant banking to
bolster earnings hurt by bond market volatility, slow retail
business and a drop in underwriting volume.
    When asked if more players would make the system more
risky, Gerstner said, "I can't comment on other firms, but
Shearson is not going to follow a feeding frenzy in the
direction of merchant banking. We are not going to overreach."
    Gerstner also spoke about securitization, or the
repackaging of debt as marketable securities.
    "It is almost imperative to create a security backed by the
funds flowing from an LDC (lessor developed countries) debt
program. It is going to happen, but it is very difficult to
create a security in the current climate," Gerstner said.
    "Securitized products could be structured for either the
retail or institutional markets," Gerstner said.
    "If you look at the junk bond phenomenom, it started out
with mostly institutional buyers. Primarily through mutual
funds, individual buyers became a presense in the market. I'd
guess we'd see a similiar situation in LDC debt," he said.
    "The fundamental thing that has to happen (before there can
be sucessful securitization) is that the debt burden on the
countries has to be reduced, and the amount of money coming
from the commerical banks and the future call for money on
commercial banks has to be reduced," Gerstner said.

that the fact that bonds rallied, commodities weakened and the
dollar remained relatively firm suggests that the central banks
may now act to provide the system with additional liquidity.
    "While further carry-over selling from yesterday and
worries about a stock decline in Japan may put further pressure

program is a substantial part of that," Hercules Aerospace head
E.J. Sheehy told Reuters.
    Hercules Inc, which also produces specialty chemicals and

    The company said the initial and still unnegotatiated

    On a specific date after that, which would have to be

recognized boundaries would begin and be completed within an
agreed time frame, according to the account of his proposals.

		<field name = "content">The Bank of New York Corp BK> said it
reaffirmed the terms of its offer for Irving Bank Corp despite
the drop in the Bank of New York's share price to 30-1/8, a
Bank of New York spokesman said.
    "The offer still stands, we have not changed our offer," a
Bank of New York spokesman said.
    Irving would not comment on how the drop in the market
affects its position on the bid or whether it would buy back
any of its own shares.
    Earlier this month, Irving rejected the bid as inadequate
and said it wanted to retain its independence.
    In late September, Bank of New York offered 80 dlrs per
share in cash for 47.4 pct of Irving. For the remaining 52.6
pct, it offered an exchange of 1.9 shares of its shares for one
Irving share.
    At that time, the stock purchase portion was worth close to
80 dlrs per share, but now that portion is worth 53 dlrs per
share for a net price of 68 dlrs, one analyst said.
    According to the prospectus offer, shareholders may tender
for all cash or all shares on a first come, first serve basis.
    Analysts were mixed about how the stock price drop would
affect the acquisition.
    "If it gets to the Irving shareholders, they would approve
it, but Irving hopes the offer won't go to the shareholders,"
said Mark Alpert, banking analyst with Bear Stearns Cos Inc.
    "And the market is saying the deal won't go through,"
Alpert said.
    "The transaction looks highly unlikely to be completed at
present. If Irving wouldn't go with the offer at 80 dlrs a
share, then they won't go at a lower price," another analyst
said.
    The analyst also doubted that Bank of New York could afford
to retain its original offer.
    However, industry sources were more uncertain about
prospects for the deal.
    "With Irving's price so low, Bank of New York's offer will
look good to Irving shareholders," said Michael Flores, a
consultant at Bank Earnings International, a consulting firm.
    The drop of Irving's share to 44 dlrs per share, which is
about a 26 dlr drop from the beginning of last week, increases
the chance that Bank of New York will succeed, Flores said.
    Analysts said that the drop in bank stock prices is likely
to depress the level of mergers and acquisition in the banking
industry.
    "Bank takeovers are less likely because banks can't use
their own stock to make acquisitions because their share price
is too depressed," Alpert said.
    Since only banks can buy another bank, the only other
possible acquirors would be a foreign bank, Alpert said.
    "In the market drop the stock of acquirors got clobbered
more than the acquirees," another analyst said.

said it made a one-day exception to its rule of prohibiting
companies from repurchasing their own stock in the last half
hour of trading, and allowed firms to continue stock
repurchases until the close of market.
    An SEC spokesperson told Reuters that the rule exception
only covered repurchases made today.
    Analysts said that widespread stock repurchases by many
firms today were a contributing factor in the market's rebound
from yesterday's huge losses.
    The rule prohibiting repurchases in the final half-hour of
trading works to prevent rapid end-of-day stock price rises
which could be caused by a company's open-market purchase of
its own stock at the end of a trading session, the spokesperson
said.
    Share repurchases today were called "a smart way to use
corporate equity," by one SEC staff member who refused to be

		<field name = "content">New York Stock Exchange chairman John
Phelan said the NYSE will continue to request that member firms
refrain from using its order-delivery systems for program
trading until the record trading volume slows down.
    He said the firms are free to use other systems to do
arbitrage between stock-index futures and their underlying
stocks. "We are going to continue to get volatility for some
time to come," Phelan told a news conference.
    He said program trading adds liquidity to the market but
"at the extreme that adds to the volatility." He said further
analysis of the issue is needed.
    Phelan said a significant number of corporations had begun
buying back their own stock in a move that helped blue chips
gain back some of Monday's losses.
    Asked how the record decline on Monday and the
unprecedented trading volume affected the financial health of
member firms, Phelan said, "As far as we can tell, member firms
are in good shape."
    He said he expects to appear at a Congression hearing in
Washington later this week that will examine the question of
program trading.
   
    Phelan said NYSE officials were in conference with other

    He said three or four of the NYSE's specialist firms

were no longer having capital problems but did not discuss

		<field name = "content">European Community (EC) agriculture
ministers gave their support in principle for a new scheme to
limit spending on the bloc's controversial farm policy at a
meeting in Luxembourg on Tuesday, Danish minister Laurits
Tornaes told journalists.
    Acceptance of the scheme, by which farmers would suffer
price cuts if their production exceeded certain norms, known in
EC jargon as stabilisers, is seen by diplomats as vital if the
EC is to solve its current massive budget crisis.
    Speaking at a news conference after chairing a two-day
meeting of farm ministers, Tornaes said: "It is no longer a
question of whether we are to have stabilisers. It is now a
question of how we are to implement them."
    However, EC sources warned that despite Tornaes' optimism,
it may be difficult to get the sort of detailed agreement
needed on the stabiliser scheme ahead of an EC heads of
government meeting in Copenhagen on December 6.
    This is the vital meeting at which EC leaders will be asked
to agree a new system of EC financing, ending the bloc's
hand-to-mouth existence which has resulted in its being unable
to agree a budget for 1988.
    Britain has said it will block moves to give the EC
additional sources of finance unless a detailed system of
stabilisers is agreed at or ahead of the summit.
    Under the most important stabiliser scheme, EC guaranteed
prices for cereals would be cut by one percentage point for
every per cent by which the annual harvest exceeded 155 mln
tonnes, a figure well below what EC farmers are capable of
producing in a year of favourable weather conditions.
   Farm ministers will meet again on November 16 to attempt to
hammer out an accord, and Danish diplomatic sources said the
meeting could last through several long nights of negotiation.
    But Tornaes said any thought that success was not
ultimately possible would be a gesture of retreat at this
stage.
    EC Commission sources said among the remaining problems
were appeals from Southern member states for protection for
their small and relatively poor farmers, and calls from France
and the Netherlands for significant changes to Commission
proposals for arable crops.
    They added that West Germany appears still reluctant to
accept the idea of production ceilings being set at the level
of the EC as a whole rather than that of member states.
    Meanwhile, the ministers made little progress in agreeing a
scheme to top up the income of poorer farmers through direct
payments, which could help to cushion the impact of stabilisers
on them.
    British minister John MacGregor told journalists :"The
proposals as they stand have very few friends."
    He said a number of countries fear they could simply
encourage further unwanted production by giving farmers the
cash to improve production methods.

    September exports were 2.694 billion dlrs, slightly down

    Salek said the accumulated surplus in the Jan-Sept period

similar 1986 period.
    Coffee accounted with 320 mln dlrs of exports, up from 222

    The Cacex director said he expected the country's trade

of the year, estimating the year's overall surplus to reach
10.2 billion dlrs, from 25.6 billion dlrs worth of exports and
15.4 billion dlrs of imports.
    He attributed the good surplus on exports of manufactured

		<field name = "AUTHOR">By Alver Carlson</field>
		<field name = "content">As official Washington sought to
restore investor confidence after Monday's Wall Street
collapse, Treasury Secretary James Baker came under fire from
critics who claimed he helped to precipitate the crisis.
    Baker's weekend blast at the West German Bundesbank for
boosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of an
international accord to stabilize currency values.
    Nigel Lawson, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, was
among those who said the treasury secretary's statements helped
spur a wave of stock sales by making already jittery investors
think that a clash between the two major economic powers would
damage the world economy.
    Lawson told a London television interviewer Tuesday, "I
think the scale of the (stock) fall was very great. That, I
think, was partly due to statements that have been made by
senior figures on the other side of the Atlantic." It was a
dispute that should never have happened, he added.
    Although Baker appeared to patch over the rift at a
hastily-called meeting with West German officials Monday, he  
still faced a storm of criticism on his return to the United
States on Tuesday. Baker cut short a long-planned trip to
Scandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis.
    Said one U.S. analyst of Baker's weekend remarks, "His
timing could not have been worse."
    One government bond salesman in New York said, "He actually
thought that yelling at the Germans, and threatening to smack
the dollar down would work. That doesn't show much
understanding of international monetary gamesmanship."
    However, some analysts said West Germany's stubborn march
toward higher interest rates may have forced Baker's hand.
    "On the surface Baker may look responsible for this, but if
you go back to see what caused it (unsettling of financial
markets), it was West German policy," said Robert Brusca of
Nikko Securities International in New York.
    "All Mr. Baker did was to mention the obvious in public, so
making him responsible for it was a little like killing the
messenger," he said.
    After Monday's talks, the U.S. and West German governments
made it clear that the Louvre currency accord, pieced together
in Paris in February, was still in effect.
    Wall Street feared that collapse of the agreement might be
a prelude to hyper-inflation and economic malaise similar to
the late 1970s. Analysts believe Monday's Wall Street crash
wiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values.
   Treasury sources said that Baker, already unhappy about
Bonn's refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep the
global recovery moving, was angered by a Bundesbank interest
rate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite.
    He felt that the U.S. recovery, inching along in its 59th
month, could no longer be the only engine of global economic
expansion. A growing U.S. economy has been serving as a huge
market for debtor country exports.
    Moreover, Baker, the consummate politician, was worried
that the Republican party might face next year's presidential
election with its main showpiece -- a vibrant economy -- badly
tarnished.
    A rise in global interest rates might worsen the debt
crisis and completely choke off U.S. economic growth that has
already slowed to a tepid 3.2 pct annual rate.
    "There's no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on the
economy, and it's important that the psychology turn around
quickly, or else obviously the panic will feed on itself, and
eventually there'll be a serious price to pay economically,"
former deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman said in a
television interview.
    In many ways, the official response was mild.
    Washington was stunned by the sudden Wall Street retreat,
with President Reagan speaking for most people by admitting
that he was "puzzled."
    U.S. government sources said the secretary immediately
returned to the Treasury to be briefed on market developments
and, presumably, their political impact.
    For all of this, it seems unlikely that Baker's status in
Washington will diminish because of the market fall.
    Asked by reporters if somebody's head should roll because
of the Wall Street retreat, Texas Democratic Senator Lloyd
Bentsen said with some irony, "Oh, I think it's much too late to
be doing that...You have an administration that's taken the
attitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and ---
retire to the living room to take a nap. You just can't do
that."

		<field name = "AUTHOR">By Hisanobu Ohse</field>
		<field name = "content">A collapse in U.S. stock prices has  hit
Japanese investors hard, since they had shifted to stocks from
bonds earlier this year, and will slow down Japanese capital
flows to the U.S., investors and stock brokers said.
   Until recently Japanese net purchases of U.S. stocks were
projected to leap to eight to 12 billion dlrs this year from
four billion dlrs in 1986, securities industry sources said.
   "The Japanese had suffered severely from U.S. bond
investments and now (they are suffering) in U.S. stocks," said
Hiroyuki Kondo of Yasuda Trust and Banking Co Ltd.
    Japanese portfolio investment was concentrated in Treasury
securities until early this year, which led to heavy currency
losses following the dollar's steep decline. Even though their
U.S. bond purchases moderated since then, Japanese investors
continued to suffer losses as bond prices fell sharply in
recent months.
    Now the historic fall in the U.S. stock market has stunned
Japanese investors, killing their appetite for U.S. stocks.
    Keita Konishi of Sumitomo Life Insurance Co said while his
firm was not panicked into an across-the-board sell-off of its
U.S. stock investments, he does not expect it to resume buying
stocks for some time.
    There has been no panic selling by Japanese institutional
investors so far during the stock price nosedive, said Susumu
Uchiyama of Yamaichi Internatinal (America), Inc. Following the
steep decline, however, Japanese are not buying, even though
U.S. stocks now appear bargain-priced, he said.
    "There will be no big wave of Japanese investment in the
U.S. for the time being," said Keiji Tsuda of Nissei BOT Asset
Management Corp, an investment advisory body to Nippon Life
Insurance Co.
    "It's the time to think twice. The psychological impact (on
investors' behaviour) will drag on considerably," he said.
    The latest turmoil in the financial market was triggered by
U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker as he threatened a futher
dollar fall in retaliation for higher West German interest rate
rises, and undermined foreign investors' confidence in the
dollar, Tsuda said.
    The U.S. economy is still sitting on the time bomb of huge
budget and trade deficits, he said, and investors' worries over
the twin problems have intensified.
    "Before I thought the dollar's large fall (over the past
two years) would take out the detonator out of that bomb, but
it hasn't," Tsuda said.
    Investors and brokers said the Japanese for the first time
have experienced the enormous volatality of the New York stock
market, often caused by "program trading."
    A stock trader at Daiwa Securities America Inc said that
while Japanese investors had been attracted by American firms'
superior performance relative to Japanese firms in terms of
earnings per share, U.S. stocks' downside potential is now much
larger than that oJapanese stocks.
    While the Japanese stock market has also taken a nosedive,
it could be stabilized by the efforts of large Japanse firms.
    A high percentage of Japanese equities are held by
companies who will hold on to their stocks and the stocks of
other Japanese firms in order to strengthen their business ties
through this cross-holding relationship, analysts said.
    Despite the massacare on the Wall Street, Japanese
investors are not expected to withdraw from U.S. stocks.
    U.S. equities are in a process to be built in
diversification of their portfolios and the portion of them is
still very small, Japanese investors said. But, it is unclear
when the Japanese will resume purchasing U.S. stocks and much
depends on the dollar's stability, they said.
    Kondo of Yasuda Trust said Japanese investors are not fully
convinced that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is
determined to fend the dollar's value and check future
inflation in the U.S.
    Because of uncertainty over the dollar's direction and
inflation in the U.S., Japanese investors have not yet jumped
on the Treasury bonds despite the latest sharp bond yield
rises, investors said.
    Konishi of Sumitomo Life said "A U.S. recession is being
talked about, so it may be time to shift back to bonds, but I
feel uneasy about buying any U.S. instruments right now."
    Tsuda of Nissei questioned the strength of the recent rally
in U.S. government bond prices. He said the steep bond market
rally has no real trend as bond prices are rising on short
covering and bills are rising on temporary fund shift from the
stock market.

Madison Partners said that given current market conditions it
has dropped its takeover bid for Dayton Hudson Corp.
    The company said it sold 1.4 mln of its 4.6 mln shares of
Dayton Hudson stock.
    It said it intends to sell the rest of its Dayton Hudson
shares. At current market levels, it would suffer a 70 mln dlr
aftertax loss on its holding, a spokesman said.
    Dart said it will not solicit authorization to call a
meeting of Dayton Hudson shareholders.
    Dart had offered to buy Dayton Hudson for 68 dlrs per
share, valuing the Minneapolis based retailer at 6.6 billion
dlrs. That offer was rejected by the company.
    Following the selloff in takeover stocks last week, and the
market's decline this week, Dayton Hudson stock closed at
27-1/2 today, off 2-1/2.
    Dart's holdings amounted to just under five pct of Dayton
Hudson.
    A Dart spokesman said the 1.4 mln shares were sold in the
market today.

		<field name = "content">A new convoy of tankers escorted by
American warships headed down the Gulf on Wednesday, towards
Iranian oil platforms still oozing smoke after having being
blasted by U.S. Navy raiders.
    Some Gulf sea captains were reported to be steering well
clear of Iran's Silkworm missiles, however, and frontline
emirate Kuwait redeployed air defences to counter the threat.
    "I think the predominant feeling ... Is of being scared this
conflict will escalate," a top West German Foreign Ministry
official, Helmut Schaefer, told reporters in Bahrain after a
tour of three Gulf states.
b
    Shipping sources said on Tuesday night at least six sea
captains had voiced fears that Iran would avenge Monday's U.S.
Raids by unleashing more Silkworm missiles at ships plying the
Gulf.
    Belgium decided two minesweepers en route for the Gulf
would stay out for the time being following Monday's U.S.
Action.
    But there was no sign that the prospect of more tit-for-tat
assaults had reduced the level of shipping activity in the
area.
    Iran, having vowed to react strongly after Monday's U.S.
Action, launched a barrage of threats and ridicule.
    For its part, Washington warned Iran again on Tuesday that
it was ready for any further hostile action.
    Pentagon officials then announced that a U.S. Guided
missile destroyer began escorting two Kuwaiti tankers flying
the U.S. flag southwards--the 80,000 tonne product carrier
Ocean City and 46,000 tonne petroleum tanker Gas King.

    There were rumors in world oil markets on Tuesday that Iran

retaliation for U.S. Attacks on Iranian oil platforms in the
Gulf on Monday. "Several shells fell in a random manner on the
northern border of the country," the official told KUNA. "It
seems these shells arose from an exchange of fire between Iran
and Iraq... No one was wounded and there were no losses."
    Diplomats said shells from the nearby Iran-Iraq warfront
had in the past fallen in the northern Kuwaiti desert.
    A senior Kuwait Petroleum Corporation official had earlier
told Reuters he was unaware of any attack against Kuwaiti oil
installations.

		<field name = "content">President Reagan said he had ordered
the administration to begin talks with congressional leaders on
a budget deficit reduction plan.
    Reagan said in a statement following a meeting with his top
economic advisers that he was prepared to order across the
board spending cuts to comply with a Federal balanced budget
law, but preferred to negotiate with Congress.
    He said he would consider anything the congressional
leadership proposed, but a spokesman said he remains opposed to
raising taxes as a way to reduce the deficit.
    "I think it is preferable, if possible that the executive
and legislative branches reach a budget deficit reduction
package. Accordingly, I am directing that discussions be
undertaken with the bipartisan leadership of the Congress for
that purpose," Reagan said.
    Asked whether he would consider raising taxes, Reagan said
"I am willing to look at whatever proposal they might have."
    As Reagan boarded the helicopter to visit his wife Nancy at
Bethesda Naval Hospital, he was questioned as to whether that
meant he was softening on his tax stance. Reagan replied "if you
heard that it must have been the helicopter."
    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater later told reporters
that Reagan was not changing his opposition to tax increases.
Fitzwater said the administration would accept automatic cuts
under the Gramm Rudman balanced budget law rather than raise
taxes.
    Earlier on Tuesday congressional leaders called for an
economic summit with the White House to address the nation's
budget and trade deficits that some analysts say were partly to
blame for the stock market drop.
    Reagan said he would be willing to participate personally
in any negotiations with Congress.
    The White House earlier seemed to reject the idea of
negotiating with Congress on the budget deficit.
    Fitzwater said this morning that the White House continued
to oppose a budget summit with Congress on the grounds that it
would be used by Democrats as a platform to press for a tax
increase.
    But Reagan announced his willingness to negotiate with
Congress after meeting for about an hour with White House Chief
of Staff Howard Baker, Treasury Secretary James Baker, Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan and chief economic
adviser Beryl Sprinkel.

		<field name = "content">Pacific Stock Exchange Chairman
Maurice Mann said the exchange may have reached record volume
again today, following yesterday's record 17.6 mln shares.
    it looks like at least the same volume as yesterday, Mann
said at a news conference following the close.
    The exchange closed one-half hour early for the second
straight day. Mann said the exchange will determine daily
whether or not to close early over the next several days.
    Mann said the only major operational problem today occurred
when the exchange had to stop trading 30 over-the-counter
options, 17 of which trading were restored later in the day.
    He said the options had to be halted because price
information on the underlying stocks was not being disseminated
on the floor quickly enough.
    "You cannot trade an option, unless you know how much its
worth," he said.
    Mann said the exchange's computer system was working better
than had been expected under the pressure of the heavy trading
volume.
    "This system was not designed to do what it did today and
yesterday," he said.
    He said technical adjustments to the system since yesterday
improved today's operations. He would not elaborate.
    Mann said the decision to close the exchange early was not
due to concerns over the vulnerability of being open one half
hour after New York closed. Rather, he said, it was to allow
trades to be tallied in conformance with other exchanges.
    In Los Angeles, traders said although trading was hectic,
they were able to keep up with orders better than yesterday.
    "We could handle the orders we got. Things seem to be
smoothing out," said Richard Goforth, a partner with Crowell
Weedon and Co who trades on the Los Angeles exchange floor.
    Goforth, added, however, traders expected to be there into
the evening sorting out the paperwork on their trades.
    Jefferies and Co Director of Trading James Melton said the
firm has been extremely busy making markets in halted stocks
and in after hours trading. He said Jefferies has been trading
about 15 hours a day, beginning at 0300 pdt.
    Melton said Jefferies made markets in such blue chip stocks
as International Business Machines IBM>, Allegis Corp AEG>
and Merck and Co MRK> while they were halted on the exchanges.
    Melton declined to give volumes of off-market trading the
company has been doing, but said, "its just very, very busy...
when the stocks are halted our markets are very active." He
said he expects the heavy volume to continue through the week.
    While sellers still predominated, Melton added, "people
were bottom fishing a little bit in the blue chips...but its
very nervous."

		<field name = "content">First RepublicBank Corp, the largest bank
holding company in Texas, reported a loss of 6.3 mln dlrs for
the third quarter and said that its non-performing loans rose
sharply because of a further deterioration in Texas's real
estate market.
    There was no comparable figure for the third quarter of
1986 because the company was formed in June 1987 through the
merger of RepublicBank Corp and Interfirst Corp.
    Non-performing loans were 3.1 billion dlrs at the end of
September, or 12.4 pct of total assets, mpared with 9.5 pct
at the end of the second quarter.
    Loans secured by real estate accounted for about 90 pct of
the 706 mln dlr increase in non-performing loans in the third
quarter, First Republicbank said.
    It said the poor shape of the office and retail housing
markets in Dallas, Houston and Austin will continue to hold
back earnings.
    "As indicated earlier in 1987 by First RepublicBank, the
company will continue to assess future common stock dividend
payments relative to earnings performance," Gerald
Fronterhouse, chairman and chief executive officier, said in a
statement.
    First RepublicBank said its third-quarter loan loss
provision of 106 mln dlrs and net charge-offs of 87 mln dlrs
left its total allowance for credit losses at 1.14 billion
dlrs, or 4.6 pct of the loan portfolio.
    The company's primary capital amounted to 7.9 pct of assets
at the end of September.
    The 6.3 mln dlr loss was sustained despite a 29 mln dlr cut
in overhead, achieved partly by staff attrition. The size of
the combined staffs of the two banks has been cut by 12 pct so
far this year, and Fronterhouse said the bank is ahead of the
schedule it set for achieving savings through the merger.

		<field name = "content">The United States may lift an
additional 84 mln dlrs in trade sanctions against Japan later
this month, Reagan Administration officials said.
    President Reagan imposed 300 mln dlrs in sanctions on
Japanese goods last April for its failure to honor a 1986
agreement to end dumping semiconductors in the U.S. and third
country markets and to open its home market to U.S. goods.
    The move raised tariffs to 100 pct from about five pct on
Japanese color television sets, hand-held power tools and
portable computers.
    Reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last June  after
Japan ended selling the semiconductors on the U.S. market at
below production costs.
    Semiconductors are the small silicon chips used for memory
and recall purposes in a wide variety of computers.
    The Administration officials said Commerce Department 
monitors showed that Japan was ending its dumping of the
semiconductors in third countries, where they had been taking
sales away from American-made semiconductors.
    They said it was likely the 51 mln dlrs in sanctions would
be lifted by the end of the month.
    The United States and Japan remain at odds over opening the
closed Japanese markets to U.S. goods.
    U.S. and Japanese officials reviewed Japan's compliance
with the agreement earlier this week.
    The periodic reviews are to continue and the remaining
sanctions to stay in force, the officials said, until Japan is
in full compliance with the semiconductor agreement.

would use kenaf fibre instead of wood, CIP president Cecil
Slenniken said in an interview.
     The kenaf plant is a member of the hibiscus family and was
artificially developed several years ago. The plant, which has
been grown in Southern Texas, reaches a height of 10 feet in
three months and is said to produce better quality newsprint
than wood pulp, a CIP official said.
     Slenniken said the company has commissioned studies for a
200,000 tonne capacity pulp mill which would use the fibre but
would need partners to begin the project.
    "We are not yet ready to commit the hundreds of millions of
dollars it would take for such a project," Slenniken said.
     He said CIP has been using the pulp on a trial basis to
make newsprint containing 90 pct kenaf fibre and 10 pct
softwood fibre at its Trois-Rivieres, Quebec plant.
    CIP, Canada's second largest newsprint producer, recently
launched a 366 mln Canadian dlr newsprint mill at Gold River,
British Columbia which is due begin producing 230,000 metric
tonnes per year by fall of 1989.

sharply criticised President Reagan for irresponsible fiscal
policies that contributed to this week's stock price collapse.
    "(Reagan) fell for that siren song that you can cut taxes
without cutting spending and that we would 'grow our way out of
this,' and everything would be wonderful," Simon said, in an
apparent reference to the massive U.S. budget deficit.
    "Every time we hear that nonsense we ought to howl with
pain as we were howling yesterday and are howling today," he
said in an interview taped this afternoon for the MacNeil
Lehrer Newshour which will air at 1930 EDT (2330 GMT).
    Simon, who held his post under presidents Nixon and Ford,
said Reagan's tax cuts are positive for saving and investment.
    And he blamed Congress for causing the U.S.'s fiscal
problems by putting self-interest ahead of national interest.
    "It's not only the president. It's Congress ... under
Republicans and Democrats alike," he said. "They're a bunch of
hypocrites who have one credo -- that credo is 'more.'"

Commission said futures markets collected clearing margins

    "The Commission remains in frequent contact with the
futures markets which trade stock index futures and options,
each of which has confirmed the collection of clearing margins
called for as a consequence of futures trading on Monday,
October 19, 1987," the CFTC said in a statement.
    Four U.S. exchanges briefly halted stock index futures
trading Tuesday, and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) urged
members to refrain from using program trading.
    Acting CFTC Chairman Kalo Hineman said CFTC continued to
"closely monitor the financial integrity of firms with
positions in the stock index futures and options markets."
    A futures industry official said there was some concern
among industry leaders that stock index futures would be blamed
for the stock market's nosedive on Monday.
    "This is an equity market problem," the official said. "Our
(U.S.) budget deficit, (and) what's going on in the Gulf appear
to be much more responsible because they shape what's happening
in futures markets."
    Some lawmakers focused criticism on index arbitrage
trading.
    Republican Senator John Heinz said he recommended to the
White House that daily trading limits be applied to stock index
futures and that index futures margins be raised.
    Democrat Representative Charles Schumer said Congress would
consider new controls over margin requirements.

    "Southland has been advised that the Commission has issued

Southland stock during various times in 1987 and the issuance
of various public statements by Southland," Southland said in a
proxy statement to shareholders.
    Southland did not elaborate on the SEC order of
investigation, and company officials could not be reached for
comment late Tuesday.
    The SEC has a long-standing policy against confirming or
denying the existence of investigations.
    The proxy statement, filed with the Securities and Exchange

called to approve the previously announced acquisition of
Southland by a company controlled by Southland chairman John
Thompson and members of his family.
    Earlier this year, a group led by Thompson acquired
majority ownership of Southland through a 77 dlrs a share

    If the merger is approved, common stock still outstanding
will be converted into the right to receive 61.32 dlrs a share

		<field name = "AUTHOR">By Lawrence Edelman</field>
		<field name = "content">The nation's exchanges and brokerage
houses said their computers systems have been strained by the
avalanche of trading triggered by the past week's stock market
collapse.
    And while the financial instry's hi-tech resources have
been able to handle the crisis, the sudden surge in trading
volume will likely force the exchanges and securities firms to
revamp their computer systems and communications networks
several years earlier than they had planned, industry officials
said.
    "We had already started certain processes to increase the
New York Stock Exchange's capacity," said Jim Squyres, a
spokesman for the Securities Industry Automation Corp, which
runs the central computer network for the New York and American
Stock Exchanges.
    "We will have to seriously consider speeding that up," he
said. After three straight days of record volume, however, many
exchanges were pushing their systems to untested limits. And
while the exchanges said their computers were handling the
crush, brokers and traders complained about lost trades and
delayed price quotes.
    The most serious problems arose on Monday, when a record
fall of 508 points in the dow and volume of more than 600 mln
shares on the New york stock exchange stunned the entire
industry.
    The American Stock Exchange's order-routing system crashed
just 10 minutes before trading closed. The Pacific Stock
Exchange suspended business a half-hour early so it could catch
up with a massive backlog of trades.
    And the price-quote feed supplied by the NYSE was cut off
several times during the day, leaving some traders with quotes
that were often 45 minutes behind the actual market.
     Although the computers whirred away late into the night,
the exchanges opened on time Tuesday and problems were fewer,
even though NYSE volume swelled to 610 mln shares. Combined
volume of the NYSE, American and over-the-counter exchanges
topped 900 mln shares.
    "I think we're equipped for this kind of trading," said
Paul Stevens, executive vice president of operations for the
American Stock Exchange.
    "The problem is less the computers, which are handling the
volume, than the strain on people," he said.
   
     "The computers might turn out to be the heroes of this
whole thing," added DuWayne Peterson, executive vice president
of technology at Merrill Lynch and Co Inc.
    In fact, officials said the biggest constraint on trading
was caused by some of the oldest machines on exchange floors,
the card printers that issue the buy and sell orders.
    But even as computer executives spoke with awe about their
systems' ability to hold up under unprecedented pressure, they
started to plan for the future.

     "We had to do a lot of innovative things to handle this
volume," said Squyres of the Securities Industry Automation
Corp (SIAC), which is jointly owned by the New York and
American Stock exchanges.
    SIAC had planned to boost the capacity of its system by up
to 50 pct by 1990. But that and other improvements will now be
made much earlier.
    Meanwhile, New York Telephone Co said Monday's panic
selling did not wreak havoc on its telephone system.
    "It was a normally heavy business day," said company
spokesman Steve Marcus.

President Reagan's retaliatory strike against Iranian targets
in the Gulf as it moved to take a greater role in making policy
in the volatile region.
    Senators voted 92-1 for a non-binding measure that endorsed
Monday's U.S. attack on two Iranian oil platforms in
retaliation for an Iranian attack last Friday on a Kuwaiti ship
flying the American flag.
    The measure said the attack was a firm indication of U.S.
resolve that Iran "cannot take military action against the
United States with impunity."
    Earlier, the Senate cut off Republican stalling tactics and
set a vote on a measure that could give Congress a larger role
in making Gulf policy. The measure, however, does not require
Reagan to comply with the 1973 War Powers Act, which could lead
to a pullout of U.S. forces from the Gulf.
    While Democrats and Republicans praised the U.S.
retaliatory strike, many voiced new fears about the growing
U.S. involvement in the Gulf and some demanded that Reagan
comply with the War Powers Act.

international trade talks that most trade-distorting farm
subsidies be phased out over a five year period, Trade Minister
Pat Carney said.
    "Agricultural subsidies and trade barriers have created a
vicious circle which continues to cause problems of
overproduction and low commodity prices," Carney told the House
of Commons.
    Carney was outlining the government's new position on the
farm trade problem that was tabled on Tuesday in Geneva in the
multilateral talks under the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade).
    While few details were released, Carney said the government
would also be pressing for an improvement in market access and
new measures to ensure countries do not erect artificial
barriers.
    "Under the Canadian proposal, all countries would have to
ensure that domestic policies and programs to address the
specific needs of their farm sectors do not distort trade," a
government background paper said.
    "Furthermore, in assessing the trade impact of programs,
credit could be given to countries which effectively control
the output of farm products," the papers said.

    S and P cited the parent's proposals to sell Bally Health
for more than 500 mln dlrs to an investor group. It noted the
transaction includes the assumption of Bally Health's debt.
    Although the investor group's plans are not known, the
acquisition will probably be debt financed and markedly
increase Bally Health's financial risk. S and P said the sale
of the unit would increase the parent's financial position.
    In a related action, Standard and Poor's affirmed the debt
ratings of Bally Manufacturing and related entities. Affirmed
were BB first mortgage bonds, BB-minus second mortgage bonds
and B-plus subordinated debt.
    S and P said pro-form debt leverage for Bally
Manufacturing, adjusted to capitalize operating leases, drops
to a still high 68 pct from an aggressive 75.5 pct at June 30.
Adjusted for asset sales, the parent company's return on
capital, 11.6 pct in 1986, should remain subpar, S and P said.

    In the bond market, the Bank of Japan offered to buy around

    The Bank of Japan was trying to reassure market

    The widely held market belief that interest rates were

they said.

		<field name = "AUTHOR">By MICHAEL GELB</field>
		<field name = "content">Monday's stock market collapse could
spell disaster for Republican hopes of retaining the White
House in 1988 -- if it proves to be the start of a general
economic downturn -- political experts said.
    "The question is does the stock market (decline) signal an
impending recession. If that is the case the Republicans will
have a very difficult time winning," independent political
analyst William Schneider told Reuters. "If the Democrats
nominate anyone halfway credible they would win," he added.
    Schneider's comments, on the heels of a 500-point decline
in the bellwheter Dow Jones stock market average, reflected the
old political adage that elections are almost always decided by
voters' feelings about their financial well being.
    "There is no doubt people always vote their pocketbook and
we don't expect 1988 to be any different," says Donald Foley,
the top spokesman for Missouri Representative Richard
Gephardt's Democratic presidential campaign.
    Foley added that the five-year old stock market rally has
shown amazing resilience and "there's no telling where the
market will be by the end of the week."
    President Reagan said he was puzzled by the day's events,
but is convinced the economy is fundamentally sound.
    "I think everyone is puzzled ... because all the business
indices are up. There is nothing wrong with the economy," he
told reporters.
    "I don't think anyone should panic because all the economic
indicators are solid," he added.
    But for the time being, the decline on Wall Street knocked
the underpinnings from his boasts that the record bull market
demonstrates the wisdom of current economic policy.
    It could also deprive the Republicans of a major argument
for keeping the White House in their hands when President
Reagan leaves office in January 1989.
    It gives a hollow ring to the words used by Vice President
George Bush just a week ago when he formally entered the White
House race.
    "We have weathered the storm. Our economy has recovered to
be the strongest in history," Bush said in reference to the
recovery from the 1981-82 recession that pushed unemployment to
its highest level since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
    "We mark next week the longest peacetime economic expansion
in our nation's recorded history," Bush bragged.
    At midday, even as Wall Street was being battered by a
record selling panic, Reagan gave a glowing account of the
economy's performance at a swearing in ceremony for his new
Commerce Secretary, William Verity.
    Indeed, the Labor Department reported earlier this month
that unemployment among American workers had fallen to an
eight-year low of 5.9 pct in September, compared to seven pct a
year ago and a Post World War Two peak of 10.7 pct in December
1982.
    But with interest rates climbing steadily and no
improvement in the record U.S. trade deficit with the rest of
the world, a number of economic experts have expressed doubts
about the staying power of the current expansion.
   Warnings of economic danger around the corner have been a
staple of Democratic campaign speeches this year.
    And Democratic party leaders here for an organizational
meeting two weeks ago predicted at that time that the economy
would be the determining factor in next year's election.
    "The 1988 election will be decided, as most peacetime
elections are, on economic issues," said Michigan party chairman
Richard Weiner.
    "In Ohio, people are uneasy. They want to know where the
economy is going," added Ohio Democratic leader James Ruvulo.
    American political history is replete with examples of
voters throwing out incumbent officeholders when the economy
turns sour -- most notably in 1932 when Democrat Franklin
Roosevelt won a landslide triumph that ended 12 years of
Republican rule and made the Democrats the nation's majority
party for more than 40 years.
    But political experts said that if Monday's stock decline
turns out to be a temporary phenomena it will have no effect on
the 1988 election.
    "Times change, conditions change," Schneider said.
    Quoting legendary baseball manager Casey Stengel, Schneider
added, "Never make predictions, especially about the future."

		<field name = "AUTHOR">By James Kynge</field>
		<field name = "content">Stock market analysts polled before Tokyo's
market opened on Tuesday said Wall Street's dramatic fall on
Monday was overdone and although Tokyo would fall drastically
at the opening it might stabilise later.
    Factors affecting the Tokyo market are not the same as
those in New York, they said.
    "Tokyo's market is completely different from New York," said
a senior analyst at Nomura Securities. "We have no computer
(program) selling, and much more stable share ownership than in
New York."
    "The discount rate in Japan cannot rise," the senior Nomura
analyst said.
    He said the Tokyo Exchange's 225-share index may fall 1,000
points on Tuesday, because of basic concern. It dropped 620.18
points to 25,746.56 on Monday.
    But he said a 1,000 point fall would be nothing compared to
New York. "New York overreacted, the dollar is rising -- that
should be a positive sign for New York," he said.
    The Tokyo Stock Exchange opens from 0900 local time (0000
GMT) to 1500 local (0600 GMT).
    The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 508 points (or 22.5
pct) to 1,738 on Monday, its biggest ever one day decline in
both absolute and percentage terms.
    Simon Smithson, a Kleinwort Benson International share
analyst, said Tokyo's market was likely to free fall in morning
trading but perhaps would stabilise later. He too predicted a
drop of perhaps 1,000 points in the index today.
    But he said overall economic conditions in the U.S. And
Japan were different. "The problems that pushed down the New
York market, like the (U.S.) budget deficit, trade deficit and
slow economic growth, do not exist in Japan," Smithson said.
    However, a stocks fund manager at a major trust bank made a
more gloomy prediction. "The situation is different in the two
markets, but you cannot ignore New York," he said.
    "Foreigners will be selling and the index funds will be
selling," he said.
    A fund manager at another Japanese trust bank said Monday's
New York fall was completely out of the range of expectations.
    "All we can do is wait now and see what happens. There seem
to be no factors which would stop the fall. There is no way we
can invest now," he said.

need for perspective by investors on fundamental economic
conditions.
    "If we are right about the fundamentals, this thing should
settle down," Labrecque said at a news conference at the
American Bankers Associatioon annual convention here.
    Labrecque also said the stock market drop could cause U.S.
monetary officials to ease credit policies.
    Inflation fears are exaggerated and Chase still believes
inflation will not rise much beyond five percent this year,
Labrecque said.
   He said strong economic conditions would permit growth to
continue well into 1988.
    "I don't think the stock market will cause a recession,"
Labrecque said.
    He said he could not estimate what the impact on Chase from
the stock market fall would be. Chase's stock price, however,
dropped 23 pct, but other money center banks suffered even
sharper losses.
    Referring to the banking industry, he said: "We're talking
about one day."
    "These are strong institutions," he said. Labrecque said he
did not think the Federal Reserve Board would tighten monetary
policy in view of the stock market's behavior.
    "If there is a bias I expect it would be a little bit the
other way," he said. Labrecque said the high U.S. budget deficit
was not the single most important factor behind the market's
worries.
    He called for closer cooperation in economic policy by the
United States, West Germany, Japan and Britain.

		<field name = "content">British foreign secretary Sir Geoffrey
Howe told his EC colleagues on Monday that Britain wants
agreement by December on a detailed plan to curb EC farm
spending if it is to sanction an increase in EC budgetary
resources.
    British diplomatic sources quoted Howe as saying that an
accord containing detailed figures and involving immediate
penalties for farmers in the case of overproduction must be
reached in advance of an EC heads of government summit meeting
in December.
    "We require numbers as well as words in all the commodity
regimes," Howe was quoted as saying.
    The EC Commission proposed last month a plan for "budgetary
stabilisers" under which there would be reductions in guaranteed
prices, restrictions of sales into intervention or increases in
coresponsibility levies if output of individual commodities
exceeded certain levels.
    Britain has so far given the clearest backing to the idea,
although several other EC states back it in outline.
    Diplomats say Britain can exercise some leverage on the
issue because the EC is in a severe budgetary crisis from which
it can only emerge if all 12 member states agree to revise the
system by which it is financed.
    The sources quoted Howe as saying: "An interim or partial
solution covering some elements of the Commission package would
be unacceptable to the United Kingdom."
    They said he insisted that any penalties imposed on farmers
for exceeding production limits must take effect in the same
marketing year as the overproduction, rather than resulting in
a price adjustment the following year.
    Howe also said there should be no question of a special
fund which could top up EC farm coffers in the event of an
unexpected development such as a major fall in the value of the
dollar.
    The Commission has suggested such a fund to deal with
emergency situations.
    French EC affairs minister Bernard Bosson told journalists
that his country could not accept the idea that there should be
no emergency reserve.
    "The British position has become tougher," he said.
    Howe was speaking at a meeting of EC foreign ministers,
which discussed the future of EC finances, and which took place
simultaneously with a farm ministers' meeting to consider the
Commission's farm spending proposals.
    Before his meeting got under way, British agriculture
minister John MacGregor said he backed the Commission proposal
to set the 1988 cereals production ceiling at 155 mln tonnes.

		<field name = "content">Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter
said on Monday that the U.S. free trade agreements with Canada
and Israel should help to pave the way for liberalizing the
global trading system.
    He said the Canadian and Israeli pacts will not set back
worldwide reform efforts under the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT) as some critics feared but help them.
    The GATT talks began a year ago in Punta del Este, Uruguay
to liberalize the global trading system and to include in it
trade in agriculture and services such as banking.
    Yeutter made his remarks at a U.S.-Israeli trade meeting
marking the second year of their bilateral accord. The
Canadian-U.S. pact, signed by two sides two weeks ago, has yet
been approved by the U.S. Congress and Canadian Parliament.
    The two free trade agreements (FTA) would gradually remove
tariffs and other barriers to cross-border trade in goods and
many services.
    Yeutter said in the aftermath of the Canadian and Israeli
pacts "other countries have realized that if they want to
continue to have access to the world's largest market, they had
better get serious about improving the GATT."
    The pact with Israel, he said, is gradually increasing
shipments both ways and the Canadian pact will substantially
increase the gross national products in both countries.
    Yeutter also said the Canadian and Israeli pacts should
serve as important precedents for progress in GATT.
    Yeutter said, "increasing trade is one of the keys to
enhanced political and economic stability around the globe."
    He said, "a stronger GATT will enhance prosperity, not only
for advanced industrial nations, but also for other countries
that need to increase trade in order to better their standards
of living."
    Yeutter added it was important not to risk the progress
made in the Israeli and Canadian trade pacts by resorting to
protectionism.
    He was referring to trade legislation pending in Congress
that would force the United States to take retaliatory actions
against nations with large trade surpluses with the United
States if the countries practiced unfair trade.
    The legislation was prompted by a growing U.S. trade
deficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is still
rising.
    Yeutter said the pressures for Congress to act were hard to
resist, but the pending legislation would undermine President
Reagan's efforts to liberalize the world trade.
    Yeutter renewed the threat of a White House veto.
    He said, "President Reagan will veto any bill that contains
serious flaws, and I believe that veto would be sustained."

		<field name = "content">EC agriculture ministers attacked
plans to penalise farmers immediately it becomes clear that
cereals output is above standard norms, EC sources said.
    They said this was the major criticism raised at a meeting
of ministers which discussed Commission proposals for curbing
spending on the cereals regime.
    The Commission wants powers to cut guaranteed prices or
raise the coresponsibility levy if output next harvest rises
above 155 mln tonnes.
    The sources said several ministers complained that changing
price levels in the middle of a season would severely damage
the financial security of farmers.
    But an EC Commission spokesman said farm commissioner Frans
Andriessen told them producers could not be guaranteed security
regardless of market circumstances.
    The sources said there was a general acceptance of the need
for some output ceilings. However, the French and Dutch
ministers called for a maximum output for a wider range of
cereal crops, rather than for cereals alone.
    The sources added West Germany wanted production ceilings
for individual countries with excess production being paid for
from national exchequers, but received no support for this
idea.
    British farm minister John MacGregor told reporters he
detected more support for his position against the penalties on
farmers being administered through higher coresponsibility
levies.
    He said he believes increasing the levies would do nothing
to increase EC cereals consumption whereas lower prices for
farmers could help in this direction.

		<field name = "AUTHOR">BY CAL MANKOWSKI</field>
		<field name = "content">Wall Street's biggest one-day drop since
1914 has revived a bitter debate about whether modern
investment techniques turn shifts in investor psychology into
colossal moves in share prices.
    "The market has gotten away from the players," said Dudley
Eppel, vice president-equity trading at Donaldson Lufkin and
Jenrette Securities Corp. He says stock index futures and
options have distorted the investment process.
    But Wall Street professionals who work with index futures
and options insist the blame is misplaced.
    Fischer Black, head of the trading and arbitrage division
at Goldman, Sachs and Co, says so-called program trading
strategies involving opposite positions in futures on stock
indices and the underlying stocks deserve almost no blame for
today's decline. "People have changed their minds about the
future of the economy," he said. Another strategy, known as
portfolio insurance, may have exagerated the decline to a small
degree, said Black.
    Eli Wachtel of Bear, Stearns and Co was emphatic. "I do not
believe the drop was precipitated by portfolio insurance or
expanded by program trading."
    "The only thing that will stop it in the end is the value
investor who comes in and says 'IBM still sells computers', and
buys for traditional reasons" said Jeffrey Miller of Miller
Tabak Hirsch and Co.
    IBM IBM> fell 31 to 104 as the Dow Jones Industrial
Average dropped more than 500 points.
    Several years ago Miller's firm was one of the first to
pursue program trading strategies, seeking to lock in an
automatic profit by taking advantage of discrepancies in the
prices of the futures and the underlying stocks. But he said
his firm has not been involved in that since late last year.
    Miller said some investors who were burned in the recent
market declines may have miscalculated the effects of portfolio
insurance. He estimated 70 to 80 billion dlrs in invested funds
prior to the decline were hedged with futures.
    The way portfolio insurance is used, Miller said, investors
at the time they protect their portfolios commit themselves to
a future course of action such as buying a put option. While
negative news such as trade deficits and budget deficits build
for months, the put options tend to be crowded into a narrow
span of time, because they are executed as the market starts to
fall.
    Miller said at present people can only guess how much
portfolio insurance is in use. He suggested some system of
disclosure could put other investors on guard that the seeds
were being planted that might add to a future decline.
    But in any case Miller argued that index futures and
options do not initiate market trends.
    People like Eppel of Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette were
steadfast in their criticism. "If I had my way there wouldn't
be any index futures," he said. "They propelled the market up
when nothing was going on and now we're paying the price."
    Another irate trader, referring to IBM's 31 point drop,
complained "what announcement did IBM make over the weekend
that made its stock drop 31 points?" IBM was as high as 175-7/8
earlier this year.
    Some economists agreed that the stock market could be
sending signals about the economy.  Allen Sinai, chief
economist for Shearson Lehman Brothers, told Reuters the 508
point decline represented "a crisis of confidence.
    "This is a a bona-fide financial crisis. The market is
showing panic. I suspect there is a wholesale deserting of our
markets by a lot of foreign investors."
    Sinai said the crisis was caused by continuing U.S. budget
and trade deficits and by rising interest rates. "This is not a
signal of the start of a recession, but a strong indicator that
one is coming if nothing is done in Washington to deal with the
budget and trade deficits," Sinai said.
    Some market participants said redemptions by investors who
own mutual funds fueled the decline. But Steve Norwitz, a
spokesman for T. Rowe Price Associates, a Baltimore-based
investment management firm, said redemptions and switches into
money market funds by Price's one mln accounts amounted to less
than two pct of assets. "It's not a rout by any means."
   
    Norwitz said the company normally receives about 3,500
telephone inquiries from its customers each day. On Friday, he
said, when the Dow index fell 108 points the volme of calls
rose to around 7,000 and today it exceeded that although he did
not have a precise number.
    Ike Kerridge, an economist with the oilfield service firm
Baker Hughes Inc., was one of several analysts who said the
evaporation of billions of dollars of paper profits could alter

		<field name = "content">News of a meeting between U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker and West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg on Monday soothed currency markets, allowing the
dollar to recoup much of the day's losses, dealers said.
    News of the meeting, which took place in Frankfurt in great
secrecy, came after the dollar fell sharply on criticism by
Baker of West German monetary policy, which had provoked fears
that the Louvre pact on currency stability was in jeopardy.
    The dollar reacted immediately to the news, rising over two
pfennigs in after hours New York trading, dealers there said.
    The announcement of the meeting, also attended by
Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, was made simultaneously
in Bonn and Washington, timed for after the closure of New York
markets.
    Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl agreed to pursue the policies
accepted under the February Louvre accord, a finance ministry
spokesman in Bonn said.
    The dollar rose to 1.7970/90 marks from New York's close of
1.7730/40. It had closed there on Friday at 1.7975/85 marks.
    The dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the market
reacted to Baker's criticism of rising West German interest
rates, and stock markets crashed worldwide. Baker had said that
West Germany was apparently breaching the Louvre accord.
    Under the accord, leading industrial democracies pledged to
coordinate economic policies to foster currency stability, with
the surplus countries, West Germany and Japan, stimulating
their economies and the U.S. promising to cut its budget
deficit.
    West German government sources said rising West German
money market rates could not be seen as a breach of the Louvre
pact. They were rather a direct reaction to higher interest
rates in the United States. U.S. Bond yields have been rising
since May on inflationary fears and in early September the Fed
raised the discount rate to 6.00 pct from 5.50.
    German yields have also risen over this period, but less
markedly, and since late September the Bundesbank has nudged up
short-term rates by changing the terms on its security
repurchase pacts, its principal instrument for steering the
money market.
    The allocation rate on the last facility was 3.85 pct,
compared with 3.60 pct. This was partly due to West Germany's
inability to uncouple itself from U.S. interest rate trends,
but also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in the
Bundesbank central bank council about excessive monetary
growth, which raised fears of domestically produced inflation,
bank economists said.
    This monetary tightening reflected a switch from the
pragmatic line pursued by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl
since early this year to stabilise the mark externally, to the
more cautious approach of Vice President Helmut Schlesinger.
    In an apparent gesture to Baker, coinciding with his visit,
the Bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity this
morning. Dealers said this was clearly a move to appease U.S.
anger over the most recent West German interest rate rises.
    "They (the Bundesbank) just don't want to come too much
under American fire," said Chris Zwermann, currency adviser at
Swiss Bank Corp here.
    "It seems to me that this is the Bundesbank beating quite a
significant retreat from its position," added Giles Keating,
economist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London.
    The significance that retreat will emerge from the terms of
the Bundesbank's next tender for a securities repurchase pact
on Tuesday, and its result on Wednesday, money market
economists said.
    Today's injection of liquidity shows that the Bundesbank
does not want a further strong rise in the tender allocation
rate, which is likely to turn out at between 3.80 and 3.90 pct,
little changed from the 3.85 pct on the last facility.
    The Bundesbank and Finance Ministry had given no indication
that the meeting would take place, although the Finance
Ministry spokesman said it had been arranged last week.
    Earlier on Monday the Finance Ministry spokesman, asked to
comment on the apparent U.S.-German clash over the Louvre
accord, went no further than quoting Stoltenberg as saying he
assumed monetary cooperation would continue.
    The spokesman said he believed Baker had already left West
Germany for Sweden on Monday. This week he is also due to visit
Denmark and Belgium.

		<field name = "content">Dwindling global crude oil reserves and
the lack of any major new discoveries in recent years will send
the world into an energy crisis by 1990, the former Atlantic
Richfield Co chairman Robert O. Anderson said.
    "It's going to come sooner than anyone thinks," Anderson
told reporters after addressing a Houston business lunch. "I
believe we're going to see a change in the world oil markets in
two to three years because oil is becoming harder to find."
    Anderson, who retired from Arco last year to form Hondo Oil
and Gas Co, said world oil consumption is approaching 60 mln
barrels a day but a current excess capacity cushion of about
4.5 mln barrels a day will rapidly disappear.
    "If you looked around the world, you could not scrape up
one mln barrels a day in shut-in production outside the Middle
East," he said. "We're soon going to be right back where we
were in 1973 and 1979."
    Anderson predicted that world oil prices would end 1987 at
about 24 dlrs a barrel and continue a gradual climb.
    "There's no way prices can stay flat because there isn't
enough supply," he said. "There have been no major oil
discoveries for the past 15 to 20 years."
    Alaska's Prudhoe Bay oil reserves, the last major world
discovery, has already produced about five billion barrels of
oil or more than half of its estimated reserves, he said.

		<field name = "content">Economist Ravi Batra, whose book warning
of a crash on Wall Street has been a best seller all summer,
said Monday's record-breaking market drop was no reason to
panic.
    "I think (investors) should stay in the market. Don't
panic. The time to panic is two years from now," Batra, a
professor at Southern Methodist University, told Reuters by
telephone from Pittsburgh, where he was to deliver a lecture at
Rockwell International Corp.
    Batra's book, "The Great Depression of 1990," predicts that
the increasing concentration of U.S. wealth will lead to a
depression.
     He said Monday's 508-point drop was set off by last week's
news of the trade deficit "and other things that added to the
total jitters."
     However, he called the fall a "mini-crash," due in part to
a change in people's attitude to the market. "In the 1920s,
people thought the market would never come down," he said, "But
today, people think it will come down at some point, and
therefore when it does, everyone wants to get out."
     "It turns a mini-crash into a maxi-crash," he said, but
added that he did not see it falling any further.
     He said he expects the government to announce by the end
of the week an agreement with Japan and West Germany to bring
interest rates down.
     "Once (interest rates) come down, the market will calm
down," he said, adding the government had other options, such
as acting on program trading, that it might be able to use to
stabilize the market.
     "But in two year's time, the government will run out of
options," he added.

		<field name = "content">Brazil will only lift the partial
moratorium on its 113-billion-dlr foreign debt after an accord
is reached with the private banks, the Finance Ministry said in
a statement.
    The statement said such agreement, currently being
negotiated, must place the debt "within the terms proposed by
Brazil on September 25."
    Brazil proposed to the private creditors a refinancing of
the interest on its foreign debt that have expired or will
expire up to 1989, totalling an overall 10.4 billion dlrs.
    Brazil also proposed the end of spreads and conversion into
bonds of part of the 70-billion dlrs owed to private banks.
    Brazil in February stopped interest payments on about 68
billion dlrs owed to private banks, and the Ministry statement
issued on Monday said this would only be lifted "when an accord
is reached."
    The statement said that a token payment, which banks want
from the Brazil as a condition to discuss an agreement, "will
only be made when there is a major progress in the
negotiations."
    Meanwhile, a World Bank mission arrived on Monday to
analyse the performance of the Brazilian economy after the new
plan launched in July by Finance Minister Luiz Carlos Bresser
Pereira.

		<field name = "content">Active Japanese investment in U.S. real
estate will continue despite a weak dollar because such
investments are strong hedges against inflation, financiers and
real estate industry experts said.
    Addressing a conference on Japanese investment in U.S. real
estate, Setsuya Tabuchi, chairman of Nomura Securities Co Ltd,
said Japanese investors are extremely cautious about investing
in Treasury securities because of currency losses suffered in
the past during the dollar's sharp decline.
    But, he added, "Real estate is a hedge against inflation,
so such investment will not decline."
    Japanese total investment in U.S. real estate last year is
estimated at around six billion dlrs, exceeding the four
billion dlrs ploughed into U.S. equities, Arther Mitchell of
Coudert Brothers, a U.S. law firm, told the conference.
    Adding in financing of real estate projects by Japanese
banks and leasing companies, the total aamount of Japanese
funds committed to U.S. real estate projects could reach 20
billion dlrs in 1987, he said.
   The dollar's fall has made U.S. property cheap, and exchange
risks are low because many Japanese firms are making
investments projected on a dollar/yen rate of 120-130, he said.
    Panelists at the conference said Japanese are now looking
at a wider variety of real estate investments, including
development projects and suburban buildings.
    Benjamin Lambert, chairman of Eastdil Realty Inc, said the
sale of 50 pct of the company to Nomura last year was designed
to expand its customer base to Japan through the securities
house's close ties with Japanese investors.
    Participation in mortgage loans is becoming popular among
Japanese, panelists said. Mortgages can be made to disguise
active purchases, and years later the loans can be converted
into ownership of the property, they said.

		<field name = "content">The United States invoked the right
of self-defense in destroying an Iranian oil platform in the
Gulf, the American delegation told the United Nations.
    Lieutenant General Vernon Walters sent letters about the
incident to Security Council President Maurizio Bucci, the
delegate of Italy, and Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar.
    U.N. press secretary Francois Giuliani said the Secretary
General had no comment on the attack, which followed his appeal
last Friday for restraint in the crisis while he pursued
efforts to obtain a ceasefire between Iran and Iraq.
    In his explanation, Walters said the United States took
defensive action in response to an Iranian attack against
American ships in the Gulf.
    He cited an Iranian Silkworm missile strike last Friday in
Kuwait waters against the United States-flag ship Sea Isle
City.
    Walters said that military forces on the destroyed Iranian
platform had engaged in a variety of actions against United
States-flag and other nonbelligerent vessels and planes.
    "In accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations
(Charter), I wish, on behalf of my government, to report that
United States forces have exercised the inherent right of
self-defense under internation law by taking defensive action
in response to attacks by . . . Iran against United States
vessels in the Gulf," Walters said.
    Members of the Security Council met behind closed doors on
Monday to discuss developments in the Gulf war, but no
statement was issued afterwards.

		<field name = "content">American lawmakers rallied behind
President Reagan for the U.S. strike against Iranian targets in
the Gulf but the attack fueled a sharp new White House-Congress
debate over limits on his powers to make war.
    The Pentagon announced on Monday that U.S. warships
destroyed a non-producing oil platform used for monitoring Gulf
ship traffic and military operations, and also raided a second
Iranian oil rig in retaliation for an earlier Iranian attack on
a Kuwaiti ship flying the American flag.
    Many Democrats, who control Congress, and Republicans
expressed support for the attack and praised it as an
appropriate "measured response."
    But Democrats and liberal Republicans voiced new fears that
the growing confrontation between Tehran and the United States
could erupt into a major war, and demanded that Reagan comply
with the 1973 War Powers Act, which could lead to a pullout of
American forces from the waterway.
    "Those who contend the strike was necessary must realize
their words are easily construed as a tacit endorsement of war
with Iran," said Sen Mark Hatfield of Oregon, a Republican.

bin Abdul Aziz met for an hour with Vice President George Bush
on Monday after U.S. naval forces destroyed one Iranian oil
platform in the Gulf and raided another.
    Asked at the start of the meeting how he felt about the
attack, the Crown Prince, who is here on an official visit,
replied, "I believe what the United States has done is their
responsibility as a superpower."
    His remark appeared to be an implicit endorsement of the
U.S. action, which the Pentagon said came in retaliation for
last Friday's Iranian missile attack on a U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti
tanker.
    Administration officials said Bush had assured the Crown
Prince the United States would "stay the course" in the Gulf.
    They said Prince Abdullah, who is deputy prime minister of
Saudi Arabia and commander of the kingdom's national guard, was
"very supportive" of the U.S. role in the strategic waterway.
    Before meeting with Bush, the Crown Prince paid a brief
courtesy call on President Reagan.
    During his stay in Washington, he was also scheduled to
meet with Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead, Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger and leaders of the House and Senate
foreign policy committees.

has allowed ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc to resume testing its
ribavirin experimental AIDS drug, according to ICN.
    "Our safety concerns are not of sufficient magnitude to
withhold approval of further clinical studies designed to
assess the safety and efficacy of ribavirin," the FDA told ICN
Chairman Milan Panic in an October 16 letter made public by
ICN.
    An FDA spokesman confirmed the authenticity of the letter.
    ICN's tests of the drug on humans were blocked last spring
after the FDA decided there was insufficient evidence of its
effectiveness against two common AIDS-related conditions.
    The tests had been intended to determine whether ribavirin
was effective against AIDS-Related Complex (ARC) and
Lymphadenopathy Syndrome or LAS.
    FDA Commissioner Frank Young disclosed in May, however,
that the agency was investigating "suspicious" test results
submitted by ICN on the antiviral drug. Young said he had
personally scolded ICN officials for making exaggerated claims
about the drug. In addition, a House subcommittee said it was
probing ICN for possible trading or financial irregularities.
    Today, the FDA said it was letting ICN test ribavirin for
safety and effectiveness in 32 patients with ARC and LAS.

		<field name = "titulo">PACIFIC EXCHANGE CLOSE BURIED IN UNFILLED ORDERS</field>
		<field name = "content">The Pacific Stock Exchange closed
half an hour early under a pile of unfilled orders on heavy,
but not record, volume of over 11 mln shares, Exchange
officials said.
    As traders remained on the floors in San Francisco and Los
Angeles, madly trying to balance their accounts long after the
close, Exchange Chairman Maurice Menn told a news conference
trading will, nevertheless, begin on time tomorrow,
at 0630 Pacific Daylight Time.
    Menn told reporters the price of a seat on the exchange
dropped to 86,000 dlrs today from 100,100 dlrs a week ago.
    Menn said the day also saw 134,000 options contracts
traded, compared to a record 202,000 contracts last friday.
    Traders both in Los Angeles and San Francisco said volume
was curbed purely by their inability to fill orders and the
chaos created by the exchange tape falling hours behind, making
it nearly impossible to get accurate price readings.
    "If we would have been able to execute the orders we got,
there would have been 20 mln shares traded," said Richard
Goforth, a partner with Crowell Weedon and Co, who trades on
the Los Angles floor of the Pacific Exchange.
    Traders in San Francisco said there were unconfirmed
reports that one brokerage house alone turned away orders for
50,000 shares they were unable to fill in late trading.
    The traders and exchange officials said action on the
Pacific Exchange did not deviate from that in New York, with
some early buying giving way to panic selling through the
close, which left the Dow Jones Industrial Average down a
record 508 points.
    "We pretty much mirrored what was going on in New York...
they couldn't fill their orders and we knew we couldn't fill
them either," said Goforth.
    While traders said they are bracing themselves for a lower
opening tomorrow, Mann attributed today's dive to panicking
young traders and to monetary policy and said the market should
still recover.
    "It depends on what the politicians do...There's no reason
it cannot go back. This is an abnormality and there is no
justification for this. People are nervous," he said.
    Mann noted he had never seen traders in San Francisco leave
on the floor so long after the close.
    In Los Angeles, one office manager commented early in the
day it was unusual to see traders on their feet.
    "Usually, they're sitting down studying the market, but its
moving so fast they don't have a chance," he said.
    In San Francisco, about 50 people on the sidewalk outside
the jammed lobby of Charles Schwab and Co, strained to see the
discount brokerage house's large ticker display.
    "I can't believe it," mumbled one onlooker.

the statement said.
    Goria said Italy's own ships were far from the platform at

events with caution.
    Italy has sent eight ships, including three frigates and
three minesweepers, to the Gulf to protect Italian merchant

		<field name = "content">A proposal to require imported
tropical oils to be labeled as saturated fats suffered a narrow
and possibly debilitating defeat in the U.S. Senate.
    The Senate Agriculture Committee rejected the proposal by a
10-8 vote, virtually snuffing out U.S. soybean producers' hopes
the plan would be adopted this year.
    A similar proposal has made no headway in the House.
    Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) offered the proposal as an
amendment to a farm spending reduction package.
    "I don't see this as a trade issue. I see it as giving
American consumers the information they need," he said.
    Proponents of the measure, including the American Soybean
Association, have claimed palm, palm kernel and coconut oils
are high in saturated fat and can contribute to heart disease.
    The U.S. soybean industry believes labels indicating
tropical oils are high in saturated fats would discourage
consumption of the oils, imported primarily from Malaysia,
Indonesia and the Philippines.
    But Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) read a letter from U.S.
Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, who said the proposal
"blatantly discriminates" against imports, would be impossible to
defend under international trade law and would harm relations
with the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.
    Yeutter's letter also said Americans derive most of their
saturated fats from meat and dairy products and relatively
little from tropical oils.
    The committee voted largely along party lines, with three

and quickly."
    Delors said if the dollar were to fall further against the
mark to levels around 1.60, the European Monetary System would
undergo a "test by fire."
    Delors said the current problems in the markets had been
caused by excessive growth in financial trading, excessive
deregulation and the failure of the fundamentals of the world
economy to adapt themselves quickly enough to changing
circumstances.
    He said it was "profoundly unjust" to blame it on recent

		<field name = "titulo">NYSE CHAIRMAN SAYS MARKET DECLINE NOT A CRASH</field>
		<field name = "content">New York Stock Exchange chairman John
Phelan said the stock market underwent a significant correction
today but he did not characterize it as a crash. He also said
the NYSE will open tomorrow on time.
    "The market underwent a significant fall and a significant
devaluation of assets of which we are all concerned," he said.
    Speaking to reporters, Phelan listed several reasons why
the market fell today. He said stocks have been going up for
five years without a correction. He also blamed inflation
fears, rising interest rates, a lower dollar and problems with
Iran. "All came together in a very nervous market" he said.
    "It's the nearest thing to a meltdown that I ever want to
see," Phelan said. Phelan said what he meant by meltdown was a
snowballing effect where selling fed on itself.
    Phelan said the NYSE is going through its standard
procedures before trading begins tomorrow. Those procedures
include checking with member firms on their liquidity, margin
positions, and backlog. "We know of no firm that has a
significant problem, but that could change at any moment," he
said.
    Asked for advice for the average investor, Phelan said, "We
do not know where the market will end up."
    The Dow Jones Industrial average declined a record 508
points to 1738.74. Volume was a record setting 605 mln shares,
almost double the previous record.
    Phelan, in response to a question on declines in foreign
markets, said he believes there is no loss of confidence in the
global economy. He added that the underlying fundamentals of
the U.S. economy are still strong, and that corporate earnings
also continue to be firm.
    Phelan explained today's record descent as being the result
of a confluence of factors, including the globalization of
markets and the proliferation of new securities instruments.
    Those two factors alone have made the market more volatile,
he said.
    Phelan also said a major factor in the decline was the fact
that there has been no major correction in the five-year bull
market. He also pointed to rising tension in the Mideast Gulf.
    The New York Stock Exchange was in constant contact with
the Securities and Exchange Commission about a possible halt in
all trading on the exchange, Phelan said. "The consensus was
that it is better to let the market try to work itself out," he
said.
    In addition, Phelan said that with the global nature of
trading there is no guarantee that halting trading on the New
York Stock Exchange would have served any purpose. Phelan said
he was in contact with the Treasury department, White House and
the Federal Reserve, but that the contact was made as a matter
of routine.

said.
    The Treasury described the meeting as "a very positive,
private meeting in Frankfurt, West Germany which had been
agreed upon last week. "The parties agreed to continue economic
cooperation under the Louvre agreement and its flexible
application including cooperation on exchange rate stability
and monetary policies," the Treasury said.
    The Treasury said Baker and Stoltenberg "are consulting with
their G-7 colleagues and are confident that this will enable
them to foster exchange rate stability around current levels."
    The Louvre pact is an agreement between the Group of Seven
leading industrial countries including the United States and
West Germany to promote currency stability.
    Baker was scheduled to visit Scandinavia and Belgium this
week and the department earlier refused to release details of
his travel itinerary, citing security considerations.

		<field name = "content">President Reagan is concerned about
the record drop in stock prices but remains convinced on the
basis of administration talks with financial experts that the
economy remains sound, the White House said.
    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in a written
statement that Reagan "watched today with concern" the decline on
Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average plunged
more than 500 points.
    The statement said Reagan had directed administration
officials to consult with leading financial experts, including
the chairmen of the Federal Reserve, the Securities and
Exchance Commission, and the New York Stock Exchange.
    "These consultations confirm our view that the underlying
economy remains sound," Fitzwater said.
    The White House statement, issued about 45 minutes after
the stock market closed, appeared designed to calm investors
worried about U.S. economic propects.
    "We are in the longest peacetime expansion in history.
Employment is at the highest level ever. Manufacturing output
is up. The trade deficit, when adjusted for changes in
currencies, is steadily improving. And, as the chairman of the
Federal Reserve Board has recently stated, there is no evidence
of a resurgence of inflation in the United States," Fitzwater
said.
   
    He said Reagan was keeping close watch on the markets in
the United States and in countries, where waves of selling
developed on Monday.
    "We will continue to closely monitor these developments,"
Fitzwater said.
    However, his three-paragraph statement gave no hint of
what, if any, action Reagan might take if the stock market
plunge continues.
    The percentage drop of 22.6 percent on Monday was the
second largest ever, exceeded only by the 24.4 percent drop on
Dec. 12, 1914.
   
    It easily eclipsed the fall of 12.8 percent on Oct. 28,
1929 which helped spark the Great Depression.
    Reagan and his top advisers discussed the market crisis,
which came on the same day American naval forces retaliated for
last Friday's alleged Iranian missile attack on a U.S. flagged
Kuwaiti tanker in the Gulf, at a White House issues luncheon.
    Presidential aides told reporters after the luncheon an
official statement was likely to be issued when the markets
closed.

    Texaco said the program could total some 17 mln dlrs in

    The agreement calls for the DOE to fund the remainder,
Texaco said, adding the private sectors share could grow if
other organizations joint the test prgram.
   
    Texaco said the experimental technique involves injecting
"sorbents" such as iron oxide or calcium compounds directly
into the gasification vessel used in its proprietary Coal
Gasification Process.
    Such in situ sulphur capture could reduce or eliminate the
need for separte clean-up devices after syhthetic gas is

		<field name = "AUTHOR">By Andrej Gustincic</field>
		<field name = "content">Yugoslavia's ambitious economic recovery
and anti-inflation plan faces major hurdles before it can be
implemented, Yugoslav economists and Western diplomats said.
    Prime Minister Branko Mikulic on Monday proposed new taxes
hitting high income earners, moonlighters, property and
interest on savings as part of new government plans to rein in
the country's 123 pct inflation.
    He also proposed price and wage restraint and the trimming
of repayments on the 20 billion dlr foreign debt in line with
currency earning abiltiy.
    "The taxes will anger many Yugoslavs struggling with
soaring prices and will be resisted in Parliament," a Western
diplomatic source said. Yugoslav economists said Mikulic's
draft plans left many questions unanswered.
    "It was a list of goals, not concrete measures," said a
senior Yugoslav economist at a leading Yugoslav research
institute.
    The state news agency Tanjug was more optimistic. It said
the proposals indicated "real economic reforms" were coming.
    Further details of the program, which Mikulic summarised in
Parliament, are to appear in the days ahead, and the draft has
to be debated and voted on by deputies in November.
    "The goals are good," a leading Belgrade economist said.
"No one can argue with that. But the million dollar question,
as with all government programs here, is how they will be
implemented."
    Zoran Popov, senior research fellow at The Belgrade
Institute for Industrial Economy said the existing system made
many of the proposals difficult to put into effect.
    "A change in the the system of taxation requires changes in
the constitution," he said. "Mikulic's speech tells us what he
wants to do, but not how."
    "It may be anti-inflationary," one diplomat said. "But the
question is how can you tax a black economy and how will the
government find out who has two jobs or more than one home."
    Economists and diplomats said the proposals could be
resisted by deputies from several of Yugoslavia's constituent
republics and provinces in defence of regional interests.
    Such resistance has blocked the nationwide implementation
of federal government economic policy on many past occasions.

terrorism or the laying of mines.
    "They obviously will look for ways that are probably more in
line with the 'silent hand' than what they have tried thus far,"
Crowe told an American Stock Exchange conference.
    He declined comment on a reporter's query whether he
favored a stronger move against Iran than that ordered by the
president.
    "We carried out the operation that was decided upon and we
carried it out with enthusiasm and I think it was
professionally and well done," Crowe said.

attack on a U.S. flag tanker, the Pentagon said.
    President Reagan and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger
warned Iran of even stronger countermeasures if the military
escalation between the two countries continued in the volatile
waterway.
    Reagan said he ordered the strike on the first platform by
four U.S. destroyers, which fired about 1,000 five-inch shells
at the Rostam oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain in the central
Gulf.
    A short time later, Navy personnel boarded a second Iranian
oil platform about five miles to the north and destroyed radar
and communications equipment before leaving the structure, the
Pentagon said.
     Defense Department spokesman Fred Hoffman told reporters
that the second platform had been abandoned by Iranian
personnel during the shelling and destruction of the first rig.
    The United States said both platforms were being used to
keep track of Gulf merchant shipping and to launch speedboat
attacks on such shipping by Iranian Revolutionary guards.

		<field name = "content">A major South African mining house
on Monday reported two of its gold mines suffered huge losses
as a result of a black miners' strike in August which crippled
about half the country's crucial gold mines.
    Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Company, one of the
six major mining houses, said the two mines suffered a combined
net loss of 9.7 mln dlrs in the three months to end-September
compared with a profit of 8.6 mln dlrs in the preceding
quarter.
    It was the first indication of the real economic impact of
the biggest wage strike in the history of the gold mining
industry, which accounts for nearly half the value of South
Africa's total exports.
    "The results were pretty disastrous, primarily due to the
impact of the strike," Ken Maxwell, head of Johannesburg
Consolidated's gold division, told a news conference in
Johannesburg.
    "We haven't recovered from the strike yet," he said, adding
that 70 percent of underground mining at the group's biggest
mine, Randfontein Estates, was halted by the three-week strike.
    Johannesburg Consolidated and its controlling company, the
giant Anglo American Corp., were hard-hit by the three-week
miners' strike, but refused to disclose production losses.
    Anglo American is due to report its quarterly gold-mine
profits later this week.

    The company was responding to an FCC proposal of August 4
that price caps replace the current rate-of-return regulation,
which has been in place for the past 20 years.
   
    ATT said vigorous competition in the long-distance industry
has made obsolete rate-of-return, which stipulates that a
company can earn no more than a fixed rate -- currently 12.2
pct -- on its investment.
    The company termed the price cap a "transitional step," and
said it hoped the FCC would support a program of regulatory
oversight, which would consist of a streamlined tariff process.

		<field name = "content">J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said
third-quarter net income rose 3.6 pct to 219.2 mln dlrs, from
211.5 mln a year earlier, partly because of reduced loan-loss
provisions and a lower income tax bill.
    For the first nine months of the year, however, Morgan
posted a loss of 140.8 mln dlrs, compared with a profit of
682.4 mln in the same period of 1986, because it set aside 875
mln dlrs in reserves in the second quarter against shaky
third-world loans.
    The provision for loan losses in the quarter was 20 mln
dlrs, down from 70 mln a year earlier.
    Morgan's tax bill was 52.4 mln dlrs in the quarter, down
from 85.3 mln a year earlier, mainly because of benefits
associated with the second-quarter loan-loss provision.
    Net interest earnings fell to 474.3 mln dlrs from 526.5 mln
as net yield narrowed to 2.71 pct from 3.13 pct and 1.3 billion
