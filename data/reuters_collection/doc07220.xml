billion francs to 388.68 billion francs at the end of February
from 375.95 billion at the end of January, the Finance Ministry
said.
    It said in a statement the rise was mainly due to inflows
of foreign currency through the exchange stabilisation fund,
which resulted in an increase of 12.41 billion francs.
    Reserves of European Currency Units rose by 25 mln francs
to 73.27 billion francs, due to interest adjustments, while
gold reserves rose by two mln francs to 218.46 billion francs.</field>
