Association of Colorado said its earnings will continue to be
under pressure this year due to the weakness of the Colorado
economy.
    The company, which today declared a regular quarterly
dividend, said it was also under pressure from the level of
non-earning assets it holds.
    The company said this pressure will be offset to a certain
extent by increased revenues from out-of-state operations and
its strong capital position.
