	<field name = "BODY">TLX Partners, a group led by Asher
Edelman, does not see any problems with its 65 dlr per share
bid for Telex Corp, a Shearson Lehman official advising the
group said.
    Several other takeover proposals have crumbled following
declines in financial markets, leading to speculation that
Edelman might also drop his offer. Telex fell 11 to 34-1/4.
    Earlier today, Carl Icahn dropped his bid to take Trans
World Airlines Inc TWA> private and Dart Group Corp DARTA.O>
said it abandoned plans to acquire Dayton Hudson Corp DH>.
    Both cited market conditions.
    "Nothing fundamental has changed with the company. The
stock price has changed, but the company hasn't changed so
there's no reason for us to change," said Daniel Good, head of
Shearson Lehman merchant banking.
    "Things are proceeding as planned, and we fully expect that
at the time we have to pay for the shares the financing will be
in place," Good said.
    Shearson has agreed to provide bridge financing of up to 
600 mln dlrs for the Edelman group.
