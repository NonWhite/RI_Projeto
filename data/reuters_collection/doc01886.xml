	<field name = "BODY">about 1,000 bolivian central bank
employees, more than 80 per cent of the workforce, accepted
management terms to quit today, a union leader said.
    "none of the employees who have decided to resign from the
institution is prepared to work again in the bank, unless many
of the economic and social conditions improve," bank workers
leader mario galindas told reuters.
    The centre-right government of president victor paz
estenssoro had approved a restructuring plan which envisaged at
least 600 redundancies, about half the bank's workforce, in
line with its policy of streamlining the state sector.
    Galindas said the bank needed at least 800 employees to
keep up its present functions.
    The bank agreed to pay a 5,000 dollar bonus to every
employee who resigned, as well as the legal redundancy terms of
three months salary plus one for every year worked.
