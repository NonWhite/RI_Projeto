	<field name = "BODY">A 24-hour strike by Belgian public
employees protesting against a government pay offer disrupted
transport and hit ferry services and shipping, port and union
officials said.
    Some cross-Channel ferry services from Ostend were
cancelled, the local news agency Belga said.
    An Antwerp port authority spokesman said electricians came
out in support, reducing ship movements to a trickle. Unions
said Ghent and other major Belgian ports were also hit.
    Few trains were running and some early morning flights by
Sabena, Belgian's national airline, were cancelled.
