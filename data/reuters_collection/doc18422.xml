	<field name = "BODY">The Japanese economy has bottomed out
after an extended period of stagnation, Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa told a press conference.
    But he said he was not too optimistic about the state of
the economy as the employment situation was still shaky in
certain regions of the country.

corporate survey showed that the economy was showing increasing
signs of recovery.
