said the Group of Seven (G-7) industrial countries should
respect pledges on monetary policy made in the February Louvre
accord on currency stability.
    "We have to strengthen the cooperation between the seven
major industrial countries and remind ourselves of the pledges
we made at the Louvre," he told journalists.
