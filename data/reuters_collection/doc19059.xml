	<field name = "BODY">Boeing Co BA> said in a statement it has
yet to see the official Japanese government report on the crash
of a Japan Air Lines (JAL) Boeing 747 in which 520 died.
    However, it said it had agreed with an earlier draft report
that the accident was caused by incorrect repairs which
remained undetected during scheduled inspections.
    The final report, released today, said faulty repairs to
the plane in 1978 by Boeing and inadequate inspection by
Transport Ministry inspectors caused the 1985 crash, the worst
single air disaster in aviation history.
    Boeing said it did not believe a similar accident could
occur under any foreseeable operating conditions but said it
had made tests and provided equipment for new planes and for
planes already in service to ensure it could not happen again.
