Petrovsky said today Moscow felt "indignation and regret" at what
he called "truly hostile statements about the Soviet Union" made
by President Reagan.
    Reagan told reporters yesterday he was ordering a
high-level review of security at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow
following a sex-and-spy scandal there and said Soviet diplomats
would not be allowed to use a new embassy in Washington until
the U.S. Moscow mission was made secure.
    Petrovsky told reporters it was not accidental that
Washington had chosen this time, only a week before a scheduled
Moscow visit by U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz, to make
accusations against the Soviet Union.
    Objective conditions existed for improving Soviet-U.S.
Relations. "But it seems that someone in Washington fails to
appreciate this process and tries to poison the atmosphere," he
said.
