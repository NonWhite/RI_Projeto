	<field name = "TITLE">UNOCAL UCL> PLANS LUBE CENTERS AT TRUCKSTOPS</field>
	<field name = "DATELINE">CHICAGO, March 2 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">Unocal Corp said it plans to introduce
truck lube centers at most of the 148 Unocal 76 Auto/TruckStops
along the nation's interstate highways.
    The company said the centers will be the first national
program to offer over-the-road trucks a convenient and complete
lube-and-oil-change service. The centers will offer a 20-point
lubrication and oil change at a suggested price of 99.95 dlrs
for most trucks.
    Unocal said the price will be the same or lower than
commercial grages and truckstops now charge in most areas.
