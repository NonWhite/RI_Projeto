	<field name = "TITLE">MURGOLD RESOURCES MGDVF> HAS PARTIAL ASSAYS</field>
	<field name = "DATELINE">TORONTO, March 2 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">Murgold Resources Inc said the number
three vein zone at its Timmins, Ontario property yielded
partial assay results of 1.08 ounces gold a short ton across an
average width of 4.2 feet and length of 200 feet.
    It said many of the individual assays were more than one
ounce a ton but had not been cut.
    The company said these results were expected, because the
structure was known from previous drilling as a narrow but very
high-grade gold vein. Its known length is 2,800 feet and will
be explored and tested as part of the underground work, Murgold
said.
