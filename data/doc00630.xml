	<field name = "TITLE">PACCAR PCAR> AND UNIT DEBT DOWNGRADED BY S/P</field>
	<field name = "DATELINE">NEW YORK, March 2 -</field>
	<field name = "BODY">Standard and Poor's Corp said it
downgraded to A-plus from AA-minus about 350 mln dlrs of senior
debt of PACCAR Inc and its unit PACCAR Financial Corp.
    S and P said PACCAR has experienced earnings weakness. But
the company remains profitable and should achieve significant
cost reductions from its recent shut down of two assembly
plants, S and P noted.
    The rating agency pointed out that price discounting has
eroded some of PACCAR's pricing advantage in the premium,
custom-built segment of the trucking industry, which is
PACCAR's traditional market niche.
