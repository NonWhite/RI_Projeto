	<field name = "BODY">Coffee quota talks at the International
Coffee Organization council meeting here continued this
afternoon, but producers and consumers still had not reached
common ground on the key issue of how to estimate export
quotas, delegates said.
    The 54 member contact group was examining a Colombian
proposal to resume quotas April 1 under the ad hoc system used
historically, with a pledge to meet again in September to
discuss how quotas would be worked out in the future, they
said.
    Delegates would not speculate on the prospects for
agreement at this time.
    "Anything could happen," one delegate said.
