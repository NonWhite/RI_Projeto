	<field name = "BODY">A Taiwan mission will leave next week for
Washington to renegotiate an agreement severely limiting the
growth of the island's textile exports, a Board of Foreign
Trade official said.
    Under the agreement signed last July, Taiwan's textile
export growth was limited to 0.5 pct each year until 1988,
based on the value of 1985 exports.
    The official said the pact was unfair because the United
States had signed more favourable agreements with Hong Kong and
South Korea. They were each given about one pct growth until
1991.
    He said Taiwan now found it difficult to compete with its
two main rivals and the problem had been made worse because of
the surging value of the Taiwan dollar.
